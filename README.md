Sumerian - English Machine Translation (HARD)
As part of the MTAAC project, the organization host Sumerian data comprising 1.5 million transliteration lines and 10K parallel lines corpus (approx). We already developed a neural network-based encode-decoder architecture for English-Sumerian Machine Translation, but that leverages the parallel dataset only, which is not sufficient to achieve state of the art results. Your task is to develop a language model using the monolingual data as well as parallel data to translate Sumerian phrases to English, and vice versa.

Your Tasks & Desired (Minimum) Outcomes:

Train and evaluate different models and architectures on standard train/development/test splits.
Experiment with all possible hyperparameter settings to obtain the best performance.
Perform a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the translations.
Better accuracy than the previous year model.
Testing different at least two NMT approaches like Cross-lingual Language Model, Dual Learning or Back-Translation.
Students with a research background will be preferred.
Getting started:

Cross-lingual Language Model
Dual Learning
Back-Translation for Unsupervised NMT
