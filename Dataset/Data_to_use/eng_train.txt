When the city of Inab already existed but the city of Kiritab did not yet exist
When the holy crown already existed but the holy tiara did not yet exist
When the holy herb already existed but the holy cedar did not yet exist
When intercourse and kissing already existed
I was the grandfather of the holy cedar I was the ancestor of the mesh tree
I was the mother and father of the white cedar I was the relative of the hashur cedar
At that time there was a princely land among the cities

Martu strode around in the great courtyard
He hit them  with a destructive  
In the great courtyard in the battle he caused them to be bandaged
in the great courtyard of Inab he lifted the bodies of the dead
Numushda rejoicing over Martu
offered him silver but he would not accept it
He offered jewels but he would not accept them
Having done so a second time
having done so a third time Martu says
Where does your silver lead Where do your jewels lead
I Martu would rather marry your daughter
I would rather marry your daughter Adgarkidug

The dragonface is the dragonface of a man 
the dragonface of a man causing evil 
approached heaven and the clouds bring no rain 
He approached the earth and the plants do not grow 
He approached the ox and its yoke does not open
He approached the stall and smashes its cheesepot 
Utterances have passed by
he approached the maiden and tossed away her towel 
He approached the nurse with the child  her arms were torn apart
He approached the vegetables  lettuce and cress became bad
He approached the garden the fruit became bad
The eye of the mountain came out from the mountain
The wild ram let its shining horns come out
May the evil eye like the sick eye be cut off
May it go to pieces like the potters burzipot on the market place
While standing while standing
while standing at the mouth of the street
it opposes the young man who has no personal god

The one who brought out appeared in  was speaking a bitter word 
They shouted at her it was an accusatory cry of wrongdoing 
After seven months had passed 
Her vizier Ninubur

She played the em drum of the assemblythrone room for her 
She circled the temples of the gods for her 
She scratched her face she scratched her nose

He gathered up that which had been destroyed in the mountain and placed it in the Tigris 
He gathered up that which had been destroyed in the mountain and placed it in the Tigris 
Now today that of the horizonentire earth everything 
The kings of the homeland profoundly rejoiced for Ninurta 
The field ripened withplaced barley 
He heaped up the grain piles 
The lord brought up harborstrading colonies from within the land 
He made the mood of the gods pleasant 
And they were praising Ninurta and his father Enlil 
At that time he also reached a compassionate state for the woman 
Ninmah because of the place where  had sex with her was not sleeping 
She made her hair cover her back like a heavy ie unshorn ewe 
She was greatly intoning a lament in the mountain that had not been stepped onhad no trails 
The mountain does not bear the supreme strength of the lord 
The furious storm that moves upon the earth depositing poison on its chest 
The mountain shall make the livestock teem for you 
The mountain range shall make the quadrupeds proliferate for you 
Digirmah who hates excessive speech 
The true lady Ninhursag the young woman 
Nintur who  when it cools in the evening 
Draw near lady I have given you supreme cosmic powers so that you shall be exaltedshall wield them 
Aruru the elder sister of Enlil stood at his front 
Great hero when you killed the hero 
Lord who like his father his utterance cannot be changed you have not yet decreed a fate 
The lord was speaking to the emery stone he was wishing forobserving its path 
In the homeland the angry lord spoke a word to him 
Ninurta lord son of Enlil was cursing him 
Emery stone you who the Asag mustered against me in the mountain 
As one who seized  in order to renderplace my hands  
As one who terrified me lord Ninurta in my own supreme dwelling 
Mighty one youth possessed of form your surpassingness and you stature shall be diminished 
Leopards that rely on their strength shall tear you up 
The powerful one shall accept a test of strength with you 
Young man emery your brothers shall heap you like flour 
You young man your shout shall be present and tremble but it shall end 
Emery by means of the weapon dog away from battle 
like something chased away by the junior shepherd 
The hero was speaking to the uu and gasura stones 
My king attended to the eleli stone 
Ninurta the son of Enlil was decreeing its fate 
eleli stone possessed of wisdom when the mountain sows discord I shall cast down my aura upon you 
Upon my rebel land whose people confront together you shall invoke my name 
You shall not diminish from your healthyintact state 
The reduction of your thickness shall be difficult 
You shall be greatly suited for my smiting weapon which kills the hero 
In my supreme courtyard a pedestal shall be set down for you 
The hero attended to the kagina stone 
He spoke to it because of its might 
Ninurta the son of Enlil was decreeing its fate 
Reverent youth who sets saturated light to the outside 
kagina stone you who put down a shout for me in the rebel land 
My hand did not conquer you as an arrogant one 
And therefore I did not bind you together with the hostile ones 
The guggazi and marhali stones 
The guggazi and marhali stones 
The guggazi and marhali stones 
The egizaga girinhiliba anzugulme and nirmuir stones 
Ninurta the son of Enlil was decreeing its fate 
Whatever  you go whether formed as male and female you thus towards my place 
You possessed no sin your hand pushes that which is a wall demonstrating solidarity or inactivity as a conspirator 
As a witness you boasted about meyourself 
I will rear you inon my lap etc together with an adviser 
nir stone you shall chose among the wine and syrup for me 
You pl shall faithfully care for gold which you are inlaid with 
Among the  of the gods 
The lands shall touch the nose in submission when you grovel 
My king attended to the flint he looked at it angrily 
At that time Erekigal slapped her thigh 
She bit her lip and considered the news 
She was speaking to Biti her chief gatekeeper 
Come Biti my chief gatekeeper 
Pay attention to what I have said to you 
She shall drag the bolts of the seven gates of the netherworld from their lock 
She shall push the single door of the palace of Ganzer push open 
The man took away her split apart skin 
What is going onis thishe doing 
Be satisfied Inanna This is the rite of the netherworld that is being completed 
When she bent downdied  her 
She sat down apart from her throne 
The seven judges of the Anuna were judging her 
Their decision was one of embittered anger 
 struck her and turned her into a smitten piece of meat 
The man hung her facefront from a crossbeam 
After seven years seven months and seven days elapsed 
She repeatedly made the lament of ruin heaps for her 
She played the em drum of the assemblythrone room for her 
She scratched her face she scratched her nose 
The place unseen when with a man she scratched her inner thigh 
She trimmedthe hair on her head like leeks 
Who are you 
From my heart to your heart from my liver to your liver  
If you are human I shall decree a fate of death for you 
They swore by the life of heaven and earth that they were gods 
 were to gobring outup 
Water of the river was offered to them but not accepted 
Barley of the field was offered to them but not accepted 
They were saying to her give us the beaten meat hanging from the beam 
They were saying give it whether it pertains to our king or our lady 
Linen does not spread over her holy knees 
Linen does not spread over her holy knees 
Her chest does not protrude like a flask 
Her fingernails are lodged in her flesh like lubi axes 
her hair is plucked like leeks upon her head 
When she cries alas my heart 
say you are exhausted our lady from saying alas my heart 
When she cries alas my liver 
say you are exhausted from saying alas my liver 
She will say Who are you 
Speak to my heart my heart to my liver my liver 
if you are humans I will determine your fate of death 
Invoke the life of heaven and earth in an oath 
The river water will be offered to you but not accepted 
The river water will be offered to you but not accepted 
the barley of the field will be offered to you but not accepted 
Say Give the beaten meat that hangs from the peg 
The beaten meat was their lady 
Say that whether it is the king or the queen give it to us 
You will give the beaten meat hanging from the peg 
They will have cast upon her it was one with the food of life it was one with the water of life 
and Inanna will stand alive again 
Bring their lady  
Inanna brought from the netherworld by the orders of Enki 
When Inanna ascended from the netherworld Anuna seized her 
Saying Who is it that ascends from the netherworld who is brought up from the netherworld intact 
If Inanna is to be brought up from the netherworld 
she is to give an ablebodied replacement on her own head 
The one before her although he was not a vizier held a weapon 
The one before her although he was not a vizier held a weapon 
The one behind her although he was not a vizier  
The small galla demons as a ukur enclosure the large galla demons as a dubban fence held fast at her side 
The small galla demons as a ukur enclosure the large galla demons as a dubban fence held fast at her side 
They were not consumers of heaped flour they were not drinkers of drawn water 
They lifted the child from the lap of a man they tore away the spouse from the lap of a man 
They did not crush bitter garlic they were people who did not eat fish they were people who did not eat leeks 
 went towards Inanna 
After Inanna came up from the netherworld Ninubur fell at her feet before her at the gate of Ganzer 
She sat in the dirt she wore a filthy garment

The shepherd was not playing the reed pipe

She looked at him it was the look of death 
She shook her head at him it was the headshake that accused one of grievous sin 
Holy Inanna was replying to the galla demons

They came towards Dumuzi

Holy Erekigal 
your praise is sweet 
Total one hundred seventy three lines 
The 3rd in a series of singlecolumn extracts in its entirety text with the incipit from great heaven towards great earth 
The junior galla demon opened his mouth and was speaking to the eldest galla demon 
Come let us go to the holy lap of Inanna 
Come Inanna Go  towards your path descend to the netherworld 
Go to the place you have plotted against descend to the netherworld 
You should not wear the holy ba garment or the pala garment the garments of your queenship go to the netherworld 
You should not equipperfect your face with allure 
You should unfasten the small uridim dogs atfrom your feet descend to the netherworld 
 you go down  does not  
They released holy Inanna they  her 
Inanna herself handed over Dumuzi 
As for the youth we will cast the esad traprestraint upon him we will place neck in the neckstock 
The ubri spear kibir weapon and the great ukur spear were raised before him 
As for the male they were about to stand they were to sit 
We will cast a rope upon his shoulder position the executioner 
As for the youth they were to bind his arm and then tighten it up 
They were to cover his own face with his own garment 
The youth raised his hands heavenwards for Utu 
Utu I am your comrade like you I am a youth 
The one who married your sister 
Because she descends to the netherworld 
I as a substitute am to be given to the netherworld 
Utu you are the judge of justice you are never to oppress anyone 
After you have altered my hands and changed my form 
I shall elude the hand of my pursuing galla demons they must not grasp me 
As a sagkal snake I shall traverse the meadows and the mountain range 
I shall take refuge with my sister Gtinanna 
Utu accepted his weeping 
He altered his hands and changed his form 
Dumuzi like a bird flying from the claws of a falcon guarded for his very life 
He took refuge with Getinanna 
She scratched her cheeks she scratched her nose 
She unleashed a spearthorn in her side she split apart her garment 
Alas my brother alas my brother the days of the youth do not  
Alas my brother the shepherd Amauumgalana the days of the youth do not  
Alas my brother the youth who does not have a comrade who does not have a friend 
Alas my brother the youth whose mother did not release her goodness 
The junior galla demons were speaking to the eldest demons 
They were galla demons without compassion who did not have a father mother spouse brother sister or son 
 removed from  the one set apart from the universe 
You are gala demons those who are to be reglected   
Who has seen someone with a healthy life without a home and all alone 
We shall go for the shepherd where getinanna is 
They were the galla demons who were to smite him by hand they were seeking him 
The lament was not yet finished in her mouth 
One of them was saying Show where your brother is but she was saying not a word to him 
He made her shave her own hair in her crotch but she was not saying a word to him 
He made her scratch her face with her own hands but she was not saying a word to him 
He made her own hands shred her garment but she was not saying a word to him 
He poured dirtsand in her crotch but she was not saying a word to him 
He did not find Dumuzi in the house of Getinanna 
The junior galla demons were speaking to the eldest demons 
Come let us go to the pure sheepfold 
They were searching they were  
they were seeking he was seen 
Saying I shall take the ax to the youth like a dilapidated house 
The sister roamed around in the city like a bird 
My brother who suffered this anathema Where shall I go I shall enter no ones house 
Lady who bears an aura amongst the furious me who rides the great me 
Inanna equipped with the  aankar weapon cloaking the battlefield with its bloodterror 
Who leans the shield upon the ground like one who runs amid the great battles 
Who clutches the storm and the stormwind 
For great lady Inanna counsel is dispensed in battle wise one 
Destroyer of the mountain she unleashed the arrow towards  by means of her power who smote with the arm in the mountain 
She screamed in the universe like a pirig creature and made the people tremble 
Like a furious pirig creature you extinguish  among the mightyclever and those disobedient to you in your bile 
My lady as you grow like heaven 
Young woman Inanna as you are supreme like the earth 
As you move inare suitable for heaven as you bear a furious aura 
As you carry the brilliant sunlight on the earth 
One who goes in the mountain range as you bring out a lapis net 
As you bathe in the pureflowering mountain 
As you fashion the uba mountain the mountain the pure place 
As you make heads roll in its battles like you were using a  weapon 
In all the lands the blackheaded sing this ilulama song sweetly 
Inanna said I am the lady when I go around heaven when I go around earth 
I am Inanna when I go around heaven when I go around earth 
When I go around the earth namely Elam and Subir 
When I go around the earth namely the land of lulubi 
When I am to thrash around in the inner mountain 
I am the lady I am the one that had approached the mountain it should notindeed it did act fearfully towards me 
I am Inanna I am the one that had approached the mountain it should notindeed it did act fearfully towards me 
I am the one that had approached the mountain range with the mountain of Ebih it should notindeed it did act fearfully towards me 
Like one who should notindeed did  towards me fromby means of its fear 
Like one who should notindeed did bring its nose near to the ground towards me 
Like one who should notindeed did drag its beard in the dust for me 
IbniSn was the scribe 
It is the month of NENEgar the 24th day 
The mountain should wish for my way 
Inanna the child of Suen 
She was dressed in the pala garment she clad herself in pleasureallurestarsrosettes 
She adorned her forehead with a redfurious aura 
She acted youthfully with the sevenheaded udugita weapon at her right 
She set her foot on the staircase of lapis 
In the evening  brought out  
She set the door that is to be marveled at open in its path 
She established the nesag offerings for An and established the siskur ritesofferings for him 
He accepted the offerings and sat in his place 
Heshe filled the seat of honor of Anheaven 
An my father I make a case to you put your ear to my words 
An imposed my aurafear of me in the heavens 
It is you who has made my word have no rival in the universe 
In the outskirts of heaven there is a silig axe 
There is a sign and a mansium royal symbol 
To flatten the platform to make firm the thrones foundation 
To set in place the arm of weaponry to bend  like a mubum tree 
To yoke a team of six and hold the position 
To yoke a team of four and extend the reins 
To smite a caravan to go to the border in an expedition 
To appear for the king in the heaped earthsand of heaven like moonlight 
If you inspirelit establish an aura your idiocy 
If your dishonesty  
You do not approach the house 
You  
If your idiocy  you increaseIf my idiocy  is diminished 
One who is experiencing pleasure why am I not your opponent 
It is a fact that you are experiencing pleasure alas it is a fact that you should stand   
After you have relaxed  I shall arise  
Servile female worker of the district the pusher of the children of man 
If my friend dropped his head in the plants then no one can know his place 
Dumuzi They were seeking his head in the plants no one found him 
If he dropped his head in the tiny plants then no one can know his place 
Dumuzi They were seeking his head in the tiny plants no one found him 
If he dropped his head in the large plants then no one can know his place 
Dumuzi They were seeking his head in the large plants no one found him 
If he dropped his head in the dikes of Arali then no one can know his place 
Dumuzi They were catching him in the dikes of Arali 
Dumuzi wept and made sobbing noises 
My sister sustained me in the city my friend killed me in the city 
May my sister station her son in the street and may he be kissed 
May my friend station his son in the street and may he not be kissed 
They were braiding a cord for him they were knotting a net for him 
They were braiding the zippatum cord for him 
They were scratching sticks of manu wood for him 
The man before him was pelting him 
The man behind him was pulling him out from his hiding place as if he was merely one cubit tall 
his arms were bound in manacles 
The young man raised his hands heavenward for Utu 
Utu you are my brother in law I am your inlaw 
You are my food carrier to the Eanna temple 
I am the one who made a betrothal gift in Uruk 
I am the one who kissed the holy lips 
I am the one who played on the holy knees the knees of Inanna 
After you have prepared my hands as the hands of a gazelle 
Utu accepted his tears as a kadra gift 
Like a compassionate person he  mercy 
After he prepared his hands as the hands of a gazelle 
After he prepared his feet as the feet of a gazelle 
He ran for his life towards  
The galla demons were seeking him no one was finding him 
Come let us go to  
They were braiding a cord for him they were knotting a net for him 
They were braiding the zippatum cord for him 
They were scratching sticks of manu wood for him 
The man before him was pelting him 
His hands were seized in handcuffs 
his arms were bound in manacles 
The young man raised his hands heavenward for Utu 
You are my food carrier to the Eanna temple 
I am the one who made a betrothal gift in Uruk 
It was the house of the old woman Belili that he ran for his life towards 
After water is poured if only water could be drunk 
After flour is poured if only water could be drunk 
After water was poured after flour was poured she sat him down there 
The old woman left the house 
The galla demons saw her 
If the old woman does not know where Dumuzi dwells 
What makes her look around with a frightened gaze

My king on your throne the one of Enlil 
NannaSuen May he be born in a span of seven days 
On your holy throne the one of great mother Ninlil 
Lord Dilimbabbar May he be born in a span of seven days 
The lord paid attention to the mountain that sustains man 
Lord Gilgamesh paid attention to the mountain that sustains man 
He was speaking to his servant Enkidu 
I want to enter into the mountain I want to establish my name 
Where a name cannot stand be inscribed I want to establish the name of the gods 
His servant Enkidu was replying 
My king if you are to enter the mountain Utu should know of it along with us 
Utu the youth Utu should know of it along with us 
The decision of the mountain of cut juniper belongs to the youth Utu Utu should know of it along with us 
Gilgamesh took a white goat kid 
He clasped a brown goat kid of the madaria delivery to his chest 
His hand held the pure scepter at his nose 
He was calling out to Utu of heaven 
If I am to enter into the mountain of cut juniper will you be my helper 
Utu from heaven was replying to him 
Utu I want to speak to you may your ear be oriented towards my words 
I shall greet you may my words be listened to 
In my city a man dies and I am distressed 
One has forgotten a man and my heart is pained 
On the city wall I stretched out my neck 
I saw a corpse floated by the river in the water 
But I should not be done thusly Thus I must be 
A tall man has never stretched to heaven 
A broad man has never engulfed the land 
I want to enter into the mountain I want to establish my name 
The 5th is  a screaming sagkal snake  splitting the mountain range 
The 7th is  flashing like lightning no one will approach its side 
The seven heroes the youth Utu gave to Gilgamesh 
They will bring the boats for portage to the base of the mountain range 
It was made pleasing there for the one who cuts the juniper 
It was made pleasing there for lord Gilgamesh 
As two companions he and Enkidu they shouted together 
The one who has a household to his household the one who has lives with a mother to his mother 
May single males acting like me act on behalf of my power 
The one who has a household to his household the one who has lives with a mother to his mother 
The single males acting like me fifty of them have acted on behalf of my power 
He set out to the house of the blacksmith 
He was pouring the metal for the blade of the aagar ax the agasilig axe the arms of heroism 
He set out to the grove of deep shade 
No one can cut a threeply rope 
Fire cannot be extinguished in a house with a reed fence 
You help me I shall help you what is it of ours that someone can take away 
When it sank when it sank 
When the Magan boat sank 
A raft a lifeboat seized  
Come let us go and have a look 
There will be an aura there will be an aura turn back 
There will be cunning there will be cunning turn back 
This is your thought but come lets go 
After someone has not even approached within 36 ninda 
Huwawa has already seized him in his house of junipercedar 
He has looked it is the look of death 
He has shaken his head taking an oath its is a head filled with punishment for sin 
He imposed his aura into his muscles and his feet 
Huwawa by means of his own strength  he said to him sit 
Huwawa sat down wept and made sobbing noises 
Gilgamesh release me 
Utu I do not know the mother that bore me I do not know the father that reared me 
I was born in the mountain you reared me 
Gilgamesh swore an oath by heaven he swore an oath by earth he swore an oath by the netherworld 
At that time Gilgamesh the native had compassion in his heart 
Enkidu may the captured bird go back to its place for me 
May the captured youth be returned to the lap of his mother 
The tall if he lacks intellect 
The Namtar demonfate will consume him the Namtar demonfate having not been revealed 
The caught bird that is to go back to its place 
The caught youth that is to be returned to the lap of its mother 
You will not return to the city of your birth mother

The one who brought out his terror 
Those distant days those distant remote days 
Those distant nights those distant remote nights 
At that time when a primeval entity was made manifest 
At that ancient time when a primeval entity was cared for 
When bread was tasted lit covered in the shrines of the land 
When the firebox was prepared in the ovens of the land 
When earth had been separated from heaven 
When  established the name of humanity on  
When Enlil had brought away the earth 
When  gifted that of the netherworld on behalf of ErekigalWhen that of the netherworld was gifted on behalf of Erekigal 
When the father rode towards the netherworld 
For the king  cast down the small stones 
For Enki  cast down the large stones 
The large ones were stones that made the reeds shake 
It was the keel of the little boat of Enki 
The bobbing turtle was overwhelmed 
For the king the water of the prow 
Was attacking in a pack like wolves 
For Enki the water of the stern 
Was slaughtering like a lion 
At that time there was a single tree a halub tree 
The one that was planted on the bank of the Euphrates 
The one that was to drink water from the Euphrates 
The power of the southern wind tore it out at its roots it ripped it out its branches 
The Euphrates struck it with floodwater 
The woman who was fearing the command of An was coming by 
Fearing the command of Enlil was coming by 
She was bringing it towards the flowering orchard of Inanna 
The woman did not water the tree as it was in her hand it was by means of her foot that she watered it 
She said When am I to I lie down on its flowering bed 
The wood thickened but its bark could not be split 
At its base a snake that was immune to incantations made a nest 
The demon maiden of the empty wind made a house in its middle 
The laughing rejoicing young woman 
Holy Inanna how she was weeping 
The day was about to break the horizon was about to light up 
The little birds at daybreak were about to shriek 
When Utu came out from his chamber 
His sister to the hero Utu 
Holy Inanna was speaking 
My brother long ago when fate was decreed 
When days of abundance elapsed in the land 
When An had brought away the sky 
When Enlil had brought away the earth 
When  gifted that of the netherworld on behalf of ErekigalWhen that of the netherworld was gifted on behalf of Erekigal 
When he rode when he rode 
When the father rode towards the netherworld 
For the lord  cast down the small stones 
For Enki  cast down the large stones 
The little ones were hammerstoneshandsized stones 
Month of NENEgar 26th day 
The ibbaru harness there was fifty mina within it  on his hips 
He tied on the fifty mina 
which weighed 7 talents and 7 mina he took hold 
At the base of the halub tree he smote the snake that was immune to incantations 
In its branches the Anzu bird took its chick and dragged it away to the mountain range 
He struck the tree at its trunk and cut its branches 
made it submitgathered the branches 
They gave it to her as her bed 
He took the base of the tree for his ballHow the base of the tree was taken for his ball 
He took the branches of the tree for his mallet 
The one who always played ball brings out the ball in the smoothed street 
The one who always boasted about himself brings out the ball in the smoothed street the young men of his city who always played ball 
Because of him the one by whom the force of widows children was ridden 
They lamented with the phrase oh my neck oh my hips 
Those who had a mother she was bringing food for her son 
Those who had a sister she was pouring water for her brother 
Away fromby means of the accusation of the widows 
And the cries to Utu of the young maidens

from where he sits destroying for him the cities 
He of rightful speech whose utterances are firmly established 
Nudimmud great lord of Eridu 
When he arrived at the Ebabbar the house of Utu 
the king who loves justice  clad in linen 
The young ones of the foreign lands he let ride off on ships 
the big ones he sent back from old age 
To those who did not return and spread out the days were not long 
The hero avenged his city 
Whatever was destroyed in Sumer in the foreign lands he destroyed 
The gods of their cities he caused to get into shoes 
their prettyface udug and lamma protective deities he let step out 
In their fertile fields of shining barley he let long grass grow 
their thick and tall trees with the axe he brought to destruction 
their small trees he uprooted 
In their wellorchards where date syrup and fig trees grew he made weeds grow 
 plants and  herbs continually break through the earth 
After the king had destroyed the cities and laid flat the city walls 
with floodwater had caused the torched foreign lands to shake 
the seed of the Guti like seedgrain had scattered 
then the silver and lapis lazuli of the foreign lands into leather pouches he put 
All their treasures he gathered together 
and all the goods of the foreign lands counted to one load 
On their delivered cattle and delivered sheep 
the name of Enlil invoking 
The hero after achieving an august revenge in the foreign lands 
adorned with expansive silver horns its ram of gold gleaming in the middle of heaven 
was caressed from the abzu 
its cabin was a palace carrying a terrible splendor on August River 
like the sky with stars it was decorated 
Its silver  
The king  
The king  
his seat on a throne of  he took 
The sim and ala drums resounded for him 
and the balaghouse drums played music for him 
My king  you have destroyed the foreign lands and plundered their cities  
like a wild bull  the hills  
the cantors for him were signing in a song 
His tireless boatmen 
hoisting and hanging sail 
with the lord their  oars hung out 
At the temples of Nippur the temples Duranki 
at the Kargetina of Enlil 
With the silver and lapis lazuli of the foreign lands put into leather pouches 
all their treasures gathered together 
he enters before Enlil 
 the king  
a destiny for ulgi he decrees 
King a destiny for you I shall decree a good destiny for you I shall decree 
ulgi a destiny for you I shall decree a good destiny for you I shall decree 
heroism as your destiny I shall decree 
Before your fierce face may no one stand 
May your crown of royalty shine radiantly 
May your sceptre be a thing of princes 
and may its shining branches provide you with shade 
May there be joy in your stomach and may you never grow weary 
May you be a breathoflife king in your assembly 
May your life flourish like herbs may it flourish like grain 
May it flourish like a right mes tree in a broad plot 
For Ningirsu 
For Ningirsu 
the mighty warrior 
of Enlil 
Gudea 
ruler  
of Laga 
made a fitting thing resplendent for him namely  
he built  
and restored for him 
to Uruk towards the princely divine powers 
With a big wild bull of the mountains with uplifted horns 
with a sheep led by the hand of an en priest at his right side 
with a reddish kid and a bearded kid doubled up on the breast 
before Inanna in the shrine of Eanna he enters 
Good shepherd ulgi loving heart dressed himself in a ma garment 
put a ili wig as a crown on his head 
Inanna marveled 
singing the lyrics 
When for the king for the lord 
when I have adorned my sides with clay 
when with resin I have colored my nose 
when with kohl I have covered my face 
when with hands of his fairness 
he has covered my hips 
when the lord who lies down beside silver Inanna 
has said I would loosen that of the lap 
when in my radiant arms he has grown calm 
when  like choice beer 
 had touched 
when my lapwool has  
my pawool he has played 
when on my sweet stomach he has lain 
like his night boat  
like his thin boat he has finished 
then the lord I shall caress 
I shall decree him a good destiny 
decree him a good destiny 
his thick arms I shall caress 
shepherdship of all lands 
as his destiny I shall decree 
The lady the mountaincrystal of heaven 
delight of the blackheaded 
by her father granted divine powers 
Inanna daughter of Suen 
for ulgi son of Ninsun 
Your walking to the fore in battle am I 
Your weapon carrier in combat like an attendant am I 
Your advocate in the assembly am I 
Your breathgiver in the campaign am I 
Shepherd chosen by  silver are you 
King good provider of Eanna are you 
carneol of Ans Irigal are you 
fir for running 
fit to take a seat on the lapis throne 
your head fit to wear a colorful 
fit for stomachhanging of the garment of royalty 
fit to open knees with mace 
fit for throwing stick and shield bound to the hips 
as to your hands fit for silver staff 
as to your feet fit for silver sandals 
You have knees On the campaign fit for running 
fit for playing like a calf of lapis on my silver breast 
May your loving stomach be lasting 
An has doned this for you may he never alter it 
May Enlil the decreer of fates never change it 
He who knows the joyful heart of Ninegal 
sheared a black kid 
bathed a white kid 
wild bulls of the mountains by their noses tied up 
up to the young man Utu raising his radiant forehead 
For ulgi good shepherd of Sumer he decress a fate 
King colorful words sweet face 
mighty hero born to be a lion 
young cow standing firm in its vigor 
valiant unbound in his strength 
whose feet trample great mountains 
the heroes of the foreign lands you have brought down 
you have trampled upon all the thrones 
your name to the edge of heaven you have established 
Your kingto Aimbabbar go in peace 
And so at Enegir city built in splendor 
did he not moor the boat 
Seed placed by the prince in the silver womb born on the bright mountain 
Ninazu like a wild bull lowing in drink 
 like date syrup ghee  
 like date syrup ghee  
 like date syrup ghee  
 like date syrup ghee  
King the lord of prayers and supplications chooses you by heart 
Who enters to your  
Who exits to your  
 who knows your stomach should not desire your strength 
what escapes your outstretched arms 
When like the thunder bird you shriek who stands before you 
When like the storm you howl 
the foreign lands open reeds ablaze mountains trembling like reeds 
in the houses of the foreign lands watching 
Tidnum well marveled 
Like Utu your terror radiates in battle 
Like Nergal your mace drools in death 
your lance reaches into the blood of the Land 
The great door of the city are you the great wall of the Land are you 
May your  call in abundance 
May the words of Enlil enormous things create shade on your head 
May the loving heart Inanna never abandon you 
he let ewes goodly produce endless lambs 
let jennies goodly produce endless kids 
then before Nanna in his Etemenniguru he enters with them 
His king Aimbabbar casts a joyous glance at him 
for ulgi the good shepherd of Sumer decreed a fate 
Hero lord mighty one of the foreign lands right arm of the Land 
you have achieved victory for me have carried out the commandeds 
The houses of the rebel lands that I have cursed you have reduced to ruin mounds 
May you never grow weary of perfecting the divine powers for me every month at new moon 
In the Egalma of Ninegal he took his seat on the silver throne 
renders the judgments of the Land in due order 
makes decisions for the Land in due order 
lets no strong man wrong the weak 
lets mother speak sweetly to her child 
Sumer is filled with abundance 
Ur prolonged in splendor 
 establishes 
Because the king exulted in his triumph and let his might radiate 
his heroism set well 
made our city Ur raise neck in prosperity 
king adorned with a face of colorful lapis son of Enlil 
lifting up head to heaven in broad crown 
with An in his lofty place taking counsel sitting with Ura on a big throne

moored them for him 
To the land of stone where no man enters 
Gudea for the Lord Ningirsu 
made way for him 
Its large stones in blocks he brought 
In a hauna boat in a nalua boat 
moored it for him 
For the governor builder of the Eninnu 
From Kima the mountain of copper 
that revealed itself to him 
the copper he excavated there in its excess basket 
For the man building his kings house 
for the governor gold from its mountain 
in its dust was brought to him 
Purified silver is being brought down for Gudea from its mountain 
Carneol like flowers from Meluhha 
it is being made plentiful for him 
From the alabaster land alabaster is brought down to him 
The shepherd building the house in silver 
He will build in copper and antimony 
The priestsmith Nintukalamma

Concerning the building of his kings house

It is him looked righteously at by Nane 
It is him the man who is in Enlils heart 
It is him the governor chosen in the heart by Enlil 
It is him Gudea born in the lofty cella 
by Gatumdu

For the second time Gudea went out of the shiny city 
he sacrificed perfect oxen and perfect goats

The shiny basket the righteous mold of deciding destinies 
he raised to Eninnu 
He tied a sinew to the hoe he went with raised head 
Lugalkurdub went in front of him 
Igalim places the road for him 
and Ningezida his god 
He did asaga in the mold 
The adab sim and ala were played for the governor 
He flattened the top of the brick with the tooth of the hoe

About his agari which rises like a mighty river 
King Enki decided its destiny for him 
He placed the brick he brought the mold into the house 
he lifted the brick from the mold 
He raised the brick he brought it to his people 
The brick raising its head to the house 
it is the cow of Nanna whose pen is shining 
She is establishing the plan of the house 
it is Nisaba whose heart knows counting 
Like a young man building a new house 
he does not allow sweet sleep to enter his eyes 
he walked to the house in great concern 
Like a man with only little food in the mouth 
he is not resting in his walking 
That his kings heart is the light of the vision dawned on him 
For Gudea the word of Ningirsu is the sign he was building under 
in his heart yearning for the building of the house 
a man gave me a good omen 
It was placed like something joyful for him 
he stretched his hand in the goat his goat was good 
He gave grain to the wave its appearance was straight

Gudea 
the ruler 
of Lagash 
when the Eninnu 
he had built for Ningirsu 
he made it as a lasting treasure 
A temple fashioned like this 
not a single ruler 
for Ningirsu 
had ever built 
He inscribed his name 
and made this fitting thing come forth resplendently 
To the commands 
of Ningirsu 
he set forth a faithful hand 
and into this stone figure 
he formed it 
For my master 
his temple 
I built 
was how he named it for him 
he had it brought to him 
Gudea 
to the statue 
do say thus 
his beloved temple 
I had debts remitted and I washed all hands 
The slave woman was made equal with her mistress 
and by the slave 
his master stood side by side 
In my city the sexually impure with respect to him Ningirsu 
I made to go out to sleep at the edge of it 
Evil to its house 
I made go back 
of Nane 
and Ningirsu 
I attended 
and a widow I did not let be put under the control of a powerful person 
a daughter of it its heir 
I made become 
The stone statue 
he made receptive to messages 
This statue 
is neither of silver nor is it of lapis lazuli 
It is neither of copper nor of tin 
nor is it of bronze 
No one must put it to any other use 
and so it is made only of diorite 
Let it stand at the place of libations 
By an act of force 
let no one destroy it 
is standing a statue of Ningirsu 
The statue 
of Gudea

of Lagash 
of Ningirsu

shall remove it 
or its inscription 
shall erase from it 
or any person who shall destroy it 
a future person whom as did my god 
his own god 
Ningirsu 
my master 
has called to from among all the people 
who then my judgments 
shall overturn 
would revoke 
and from my collected songs 
shall set his own name on them 
who in the courtyard of Ningirsu my master 
without having kept before his eyes 
that since days of old 
since the seed first emerged 
when a ruler 
the Eninnu 
for Ningirsu 
my master 
had built
being a person who had made a fitting thing come forth resplendently

Since the time fate was decreed
no king
in the borderland

had ever founded
the mighty king
king of Ur
and king of the four world quarters
Simnum
he founded for them
with the persons he had made into his booty
for Enlil and Ninlil
on the borderland
of Nippur

Since that time

like a wolfs

A people who do not know barley

The Amorites a destructive people
the Tidnumites
and the Iamadiumites

Its kings

May his name in all the lands
be known
Before all the great gods
pass by
of Enlil
may he lift high his shoulders
if off its standing place
one removes it
and a stone statue of himself
one makes stand upon it
or he who my handiwork
shall erase
For Enlil
king of all the lands
his master
Sn
chosen by name
by An
by Enlil
the king whom Enlil
in his heart
did choose
as the shepherd of the country
and of the four world quarters
the mighty king
king of Ur
When Enlil
and longevity
crown and tiara
the throne of kingship
years of abundance
a flood of weapons
which cast forth great fearsomeness
the royal ankaraweapon
the weapon of war
the weapon of heroism
whose fearsomeness and divine radiance
reaches up to heaven
whose roar
covers the rebel lands
from across
the Lower Sea
to the Upper Sea
the river 
the distant mountain places
the peoples
all their lords and enthroned ones
the king nominated by An
when Enlil
the lord through whose command
all is created

his king chosen by his sacred heart

Sn
the mighty king
king of Ur
and king of the four world quarters
by the power of Enlil
his master
and by the command of Ninlil
his beloved mistress
in those wars and battles
he was repeatedly victorious
Their head warriors
Their runners
he weakened
Their strong and weak
he killed like dogs
The heads of their righteous and treacherous ones alike
he strewed like seeds
All their lords and enthroned ones
he took into capitivity
All the great governors
of the territories
of Zabali
and
all the governors
whom he had brought back from the wars
their governors and enthroned ones
before Enlil
and Ninlil
he did 
The young men
who from the grasp of battle
had fallen out
like fleeing birds had saved their lives
Towards their cities
like an Anzueagle he himself
screeched
Their settled cities and towns
and their walls
he demolished
The young men of their cities
which he had conquered
he removed their eyes
and in the orchards of Enlil
and Ninlil
and
in the orchards of the great gods
Further the young women
which he had conquered
in the weavinghouses
and Ninlil
and
the temples of the great gods
Their cattle sheep goats and donkeys
which he brought in
and in the temples of Enlil
and Ninlil
and
the temples of the great gods
he sacrificed them
and things fashioned from them
into big sacks
he filled
Copper
bronze
and things fashioned from them
he tied onto the backs of donkeys
and for the temples of Enlil
Ninlil
the temples of the great gods
into treasures
he made them
Sn
the king nominated by An
by Enlil
that from this day foreward
the praise of them
should not fall from the lips
but should rather be handed down 
Bulma
in the land of imaki
like 
he cast down
those living beings having names
He having revealed it to

not be erased

Mardama
Sn
the king and shepherd of the BlackHeaded Folk
he raised there
and covered them with the garment of it
Gold and silver
to mine
he set them to work
At that time
Sn
the mighty king
king of Ur
and king of the four world quarters
the gold
of the territories
which he had made into booty
into this stone figure of himself
he fashioned
and to Enlil
his master
for his life
he dedicated it
A person who an order of wickedness
shall issue against it
and this inscription
and his own name
shall write upon it
or that which I have fashioned
he shall destroy
may Enlil

Envoys of Aga the son of Enmebaragesi 
from Kish to Gilgamesh in Uruk came 
Gilgamesh before the elders of his city 
presented the issue carefully choosing his words 
There are wells to be finished wells of the Land yet to be finished 
there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished 
there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed 
To the house of Kish We should not submit Should we not smite it with weapons 
answer Gilgamesh 
There are indeed wells to be finished wells of the Land yet to be finished 
there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished 
there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed 
So we should submit to the house of Kish We should not smite it with weapons 
Gilgamesh the lord of Kulaba 
in Inanna placing his trust 
the advice of the elders of his city did not take seriously 
presented the issue carefully choosing his words 
There are wells to be finished wells of the Land yet to be finished 
there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished 
there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed 
In the convened assembly the ablebodied men of his city answer Gilgamesh 
Standing on duty and sitting in attendance 
the son of the king escorting 
the reins of the donkey always grasping 
To the house of Kish you all should not submit With weapons should we not smite it 
The structure of Uruk the handiwork of the gods 
and of Eanna the house from heaven lowered down 
The great wall the wall which An founded 
the majestic residence which An established 
you watch over You are its king and warrior 
When Aga comes what terror he will experience 
That army is small at the rear scattered 
Its men will be incapable of confronting us 
Then Gilgamesh the lord of Kulaba 
at the advice of the ablebodied men of his city rejoiced and his spirit brightened 
His servant Enkidu he addressed 
On this account let the weaponry and arms of battle be made ready 
Let the battle mace to your side return 
A great terror and radiance may they create 
His reasoning will become confused his judgment disarrayed 
Not 5 days not 1 days had passed 
when Aga the son of Enmebaragesi to Uruk with his men laid siege  
Uruks reasoning became confused 
Gilgamesh the lord of Kulaba 
to its warriors speaks 
Let someone with courage rise up I shall go against Aga 
I shall go against Aga 
at the gate of the city gate they captured him 
Birurturas entire length beating 
Into the presence of Aga he came 
speaking to Aga 
out over the wall leaned 
Aga trained his eyes 
to Birurtura speaking 
Slave is that man your king 
That man is not my king 
Were that man my king 
were that his angry brow 
were that his lapis lazuli beard 
were those his elegant fingers 
would he not cast down multitudes Would he not raise up multitudes 
Would multitudes not be smeared with dust 
Would not all the nations be overwhelmed 
Would not the canalmouths of the land be filled with silt 
Would not the horns of the barges be broken 
Would he not take captive Aga the king of Kish in the midst of his army 
Hitting him striking him 
Birurturas entire length they were beating 
After the mirrorholder of Uruk Gilgamesh climbs up on the wall 
The ablebodied men of Uruk with battle maces he armed 
Enkidu through the city gate alone went out 
Gilgamesh out over the wall leaned 
Slave is that man your king 
That man is indeed my king 
It was just as he had said 
Multitudes fell multitudes rose up 
multitudes with dust were smeared 
all the nations were overwhelmed 
the canalmouths of the land with silt were filled 
the horns of the barges were broken 
Gilgamesh the lord of Kulaba 
to Aga speaks 
Aga my foreman Aga my lieutenant 
Aga my commander of the troops 
Aga gave me breath Aga gave me life 
Aga a fugitive into his embrace took 
Aga the fleeing bird with grain provided 
Uruk the handiwork of the gods 
the great wall the wall which An founded 
the majestic residence which An established 
you watch over You are its king and warrior 
an exuberant person a prince beloved of An 
Before Utu your former kindness is hereby repaid to you 
Aga to Kish he set free 
As to Gilgamesh lord of Kulaba 
your praise is sweet 
Enlil Gutium
the fanged snake of the mountain ranges
a people who acted violently against the gods
people who the kingship

who Sumer
with wickedness filled
who from one with a wife his wife
who from one with a child his child
took away from him
who wickedness and violence
produced within the country
Enlil the king of all the lands
to obliterate its name
Utuegal
the mighty man
the king of Uruk
the king of the four world quarters
Enlil the king of all the lands
issued to him a command about this
To Inanna his lady
he went
and prayed to her saying
My lady lioness of battle
who the foreign lands batters
Enlil the kingship of Sumer
to return to its own control
he commanded me
May you be my ally
bore down upon the land everywhere
the king of Gutium
but no one came out against him
Both banks of the Tigris
he had seized
To the south in Sumer
the cultivated land he tied up
to the north the roads he tied up
he made tall grasses grow
had given power
whom Inanna by her own heart had chosen
Utuegal the mighty man
from Uruk went out against him
To the citizens of his city
he was calling out saying
Gutium
Enlil has given to me
My mistress Inanna
DumuziAmauumgalana
has declared It is something that concerns me
and Gilgame
the son of Ninsun
as bailiff he has given to me
The citizens of Uruk
and the citizens of Kullab
he caused to rejoice at this
His city as one man
followed after him
The military contingents and scouts
he put in good order
After having departed from the temple of Ikur
on the 4th day in Nagsu on the Enurigal canal
he made an offering
On the 5th day at BaraIlitappe
and NabiEnlil
generals of Tirigan
who to Sumer as envoys
had been sent
Having departed from BaraIlitappe
on the 6th day at Karkar
he made an offering
and prayed to him
O Ikur Enlil has given me the weapons
may you be my ally
In the middle of that night he arose
when Utu had risen
he went
and prayed to him saying
O Utu Gutium
Enlil has given to me
may you be my ally
At that place just beyond Gutium
he laid a trap for him
and the troops he drove to him
Utuegal the mighty man
defeated
their generals Whereupon Tirigan
king of Gutium
fled all alone from there
The place where to save his life
in Dabrum they at first were good to him
But the people of Dabrum
Utuegal
because he a king to whom Enlil had given power
they did not let go
By the envoys of Utuegal
Tirigan
and his wife and children
in Dabrum were captured
and put a cloth blindfold over his eyes
Utuegal before Utu
made him lie at his Utus feet
and on his neck he set his foot
he made drink from the cracks in the earth
The towboats he dispatched from its borders
and the kingship of Sumer to its control he returned

steadfastly 
had spoken

for Utu I stacked up 
I enlarged the cattle pens and sheepfolds 
I increased the fat and cheese 
My people much food 
I let eat 
From their midst the robbers wicked persons 
The weak the widows and the destitute 
I improved their lives
At the time of my good reign 
1 minas of wool
1 kor dates 
at the market rate in my country  
one shekel silver
At that time the great wall of Larsa 
The wages per man 
2 shekels oil 
such for one day they received   
In order to establish my name for eternity 
for this great wall 
I sank the holy foundation pegs 
and Utu His Victory
has Attained
I named it 
By the righteous verdict of Utu 
the city against which battle 
its walls I counted as ruined mounds
I made bend down to the feet of Utu my master
The boundary mound of Utu 
my master 
I restored
for the lord great lion the decider of heaven and earth 
wild bull who is set against the sky like a torch 
steadfast youth  of wide heaven 
who attends to the living and the dead 
who alone makes perfect those divine powers 
the prince youthful Utu 
most suited for the holy crown 
filled with compassion who loves exvotos
who listens to prayers 
for his master 
Siniddinam the mighty man 
provider of Ur 
who the divine plan of Eridu  
did restore 
who perfects the divine attributes of Laga 
and Girsu 
mighty heir who gladdens the heart of his father 
firstborn son of Ikur 
a silver standing statue of the father who begot him  
NurAdad 
with beautiful features
set with inscriptions 
he fashioned for him
and for his life 
he dedicated to him 
In the main courtyard of the shrine Ebabbar 
the most wonderous place of the nation 
in his exalted temple for offerings  
most suitable
he stood it up 
I Siniddinam 
the mighty man 
provider of Ur 
king of Larsa 
king of Sumer and Akkad 
the king who the Ebabbar the temple of Utu 
did build 
and who the divine plans of the temples of the gods 
when An Enlil Nanna and Utu 
a favorable reign of justice 
whose days have been prolonged 
did present to me 
by means of my broad wisdom 
and preeminent  
for my cities and land 
to produce good water
as well as the course and praise
of my heroism
to make highly resplendent 
to An and Enlil 
I made pleasing words 
and they to my righteous prayers  
having been agreeable 
for the digging of the Tigris 
and its restoring 
also through long days of life
to establish my name 
with their unalterable words
they issued orders to me 
At that time by the commands 
of An and Inanna 
with the agreement of Enlil and Ninlil 
and of Ikur my personal god
my helper 
and by the exalted power of Nanna and Utu 
the Tigris 
Utus river of abundance 
by means of my triumph 
I dug there in a grand fashion 
Up to the border territory my chosen boundary mound 
I brought its beginning 
and into a marsh 
I directed it in a great fashion 
Thus a constant water supply 
a ceaseless abundance 
I established
When the Tigris the great river 
the wages for one man were 
1 kor barley each 
2 sila bread each 
and 2 shekels oil each 
in one day 
thusly they received it
Either a man less wages 
or a man more wages 
I did not let him take
Through the strength of the land 
I completed that work 
By means of the commands and divine decisions 
of the great gods 
and so for all future time 
I have indeed made my name stand forth 
For Utu 
Siniddinam 
the mighty man 
provider of Ur 
king of Larsa

provider of Ur 
king of Larsa 
and king of Sumer and Akkad 
in order to  
to Utu my master 
I spoke pleasing words 
and to the prayers of my hearts desire
he was agreeable
At that time through the willingness 
of my master 
the Ebabbar his beloved temple 
I built for him 
Like a lifted up mountain range 
I raised up its top for him 
and in his residence which pleases the heart 
I let Utu dwell
For Utu 
lord and judge of heaven and earth 
learned in decision 
who chooses the right 
the king of the Ebabbar temple 
his master 
the shepherd who provides everything in abundance  
for Nippur 
king of Larsa 
and king of Sumer and Akkad 
the Ebabbar 
his beloved temple 
he built for him 
he enlarged its residence 
For that which was done   
may Utu 
and a good life 
as a gift 
may he allot to him 
When Utu the shrine Ebabbars 
fate did determine 
to perfect the divine attributes and plans 
to enlarge its residence
and greatly to 
 he having spoken 
then it was towards me Siniddinam 
the mighty man 
the provider of Ur 
and king of Sumer and Akkad 
that youthful Utu out of all the lands 
To the shepherdship of Larsa 
he raised me up 
its troops of numerous areas 
at my command he made dwell 
and all the great orders for them 
he put fully into my hands 
to enlarge widely 
in view of my reverence 
regarding it he gave me orders  
At that time Utu my master 
through my pleasing words of prayer 
any cause for complaint from my city  
he removed 
The army of Larsa 
I having made dwell together as one  
wages food ointment 
enough to please the heart 
to the men doing that work 
I did give
During a single year 
the baked bricks for it 
and the Ebabbar his beloved temple  
its exalted high terrace
I built for him 
When the Ebabbar shrine itself 
I had built 
The wages per person were 
 kor of barley each 
2 sila of dates each 
2 sila of cheese each 
2 sila of sesame bran each 
2 shekels of oil each 
apart from the sheepfold edibles
in one day
thus one received 
In the days of my excellent reign 
which Utu my master 
gave to me 
4 kor barely 
12 kur dates 
3 ban oil 
5 ban of lard 
at the market rate in Ur 
thusly did purchase

at that time with a shining countenance 
which gladdens the heart of my city 
on the shrine Ebabbar

Letting it have the use of the abundance of the sea and mountains 
and as well making it rush into war and battle in the nation   
he gave it as a gift
to return what was their land to their control 
to establish water therein and so to prolong their lives 
by their word they brought him to do this 
me the wise one possessing intelligence who loves what is right 
me who was colored in sacred fashion from the very womb of my mother 
he Nanna placed me in the position of shepherd in his land 
bestowed upon me a happy reign 
and made his numerous people dwell under my command  
To renovate the Etemenniguru temple 
to thicken the base of the shrine Ebabbar

whose wide shadow covers foreign land as well as the nation 
from whose good base the Black Headed People 
the building of its wall he placed in my hands  
In the middle of that five months had not elapsed 
when I had baked its bricks
Like a verdant mountain range I made it grow on a pure place 
Its height I made surpassing and set free its awesome radiance 
As a marvel of the nation 
In its foundations for the foundation documents of my kingship 
I strengthened its demarcating levee 
circled it with bricks 
and dug its moat

For Nanna
the lord the great lion of heaven and earth
his master
IbbiSn
the god of his country
the sovereign who how every sort of divine attribute
should be properly performed knows fully
the mighty king
king of Ur
and king of the four world quarters
when in Susa
he roared like a storm
and took their lords into captivity
because Nanna
had brought them back in his great arm
and had taken away their heavy gold and dark silver
the prince with great power clad in fearsomeness
with wide intelligence 
a golden seventeat jar
whose openings let out honeyed water
whose golden drinking reed
is a channel running majestically
a thing fit for the firstfruits offerings
whose copper sickles
a mountain range growing pure clean junipers
with breasts making things numerous
for youthful Suen
for his life
he dedicated it to him
A person who the order of an evil thing
shall issue regarding it
and from the exalted platform of the divine dining hall
and the festival place
of Nanna
shall cause it to be held back
may the great gods of heaven and earth
curse him
issuing divine decisions whose word cannot be altered with  planning placed in his hands 
ImeDagan the strong young man with the muscles and body of a lion strong youth possessing fearsomeness 
who alone is exalted lord whose called good name is demonstrated in all lands 
under his sway he has made the living creatures numerous 
and into whose hand were given the Black Headed People in their shelters where the people reside 
They prepared correctly for him the firstfruit offerings of the land 
At that time ImeDagan the youth the hero of the runners 
to Nippur being the city where the seed of the myriad people sprang up where the living were born 
the reverent runner who serves night and day without ceasing 
who daily brings everything needed made a great resolution 
When he rises up it is gigantic a flood bringing a wind in its fury 
With his arms swinging open over and over he flashes across distant miles 
like a fierce lion of the steppe going with strength and youthfulness 
opening wide his knees on the highway striding towards battle and combat 
like a horse  on the highway with its tail extended 
like a buck when racing around inspiring fear  
whose his knees when set free are untiring  
the son who brings everything for Enlil 
and also that which gladdens the heart of Ninlil 
the king cares unceasingly for the lapis lazuli shrine 
At that time ImeDagan a copper statue which inspires fear as it races against the storm 
in the temple clad in fearsomeness upon his most precious dais 
he set it up and colored it brilliantly 
The great prince of the whole heaven the lord whose utterance cannot be altered 
his shining brow and raised righteous eyes 
may he let be upon him directed towards the faithful shepherd whom he has engendered 
But a king who orders a wicked thing 
and erases this inscription and writes his own name upon it 
or because of this curse incites another person to do it 
May Enki Ikur Ezinu and akan the lords of abundance 
after locking up abundance in heaven and earth  him evilly 
For Ninlil the exalted queen  
most resplendant of of the Anuna gods 
 in heaven and earth 
like  
their daises 
their daises 
he the one given the crown and scepter
for the great mother of the Anuna gods 
the mistress of the Kiur 
the exalted shrine Ekurs 
divine attributes to select 
the Nippur shrine Durankis 
ritual lustrations to cleanse 
to make the divine rites that had fallen away 
reappear magnificently
and Nippur the bellwether of the nation
to restore to its previous state
it was UrNinurta
upon whom Enlil the king of all the lands
out over the broad population
did lift his eye
and did rightly choose
for An Enlil and Ninlil
I removed evil
and in the shining Ekur temple in the city  
I set them up for them
Further copper figures whose bodily features  
were made to resemble me 
with an offering kid
as the main courtyard of the Gagiuas  
ornament I fashioned for her Ninlil 
and for my life
I dedicated them to her
A person who an order of wickedness  
shall issue against it
shall efface
by the exalted command of Enlil
be revoked from within the Ekur
May Ninurta the mighty warrior of Enlil 
be the inseparable bailiff for this
for an eternity of days

When she split apart the man brought  away 
Her sister raised her up from her throne 
The throne of her sister  
The seven judges of the Anuna judged her case before her 
She looked at her it was the look of death 
For her Erekigal he turned her Inanna into a smitten piece of meat 
He hung her from a peg 
After seven years seven months and seven days elapsed 
She Ninubur scratched her face she scratched her nose 
She took a single path to the Ekur the temple of Enlil 
She entered the Ekur the temple of Enlil 
She was weeping before Enlil 
No one should be allowed to mix your good quality silver with the unrefined ore of the mountain 
No one should be allowed to split apart your boxwood among the wood of the carpenter 
No one should be allowed to kill young woman Inanna in the netherworld

While enraged Enlil answered Ninubur 
My child wished for great heaven and the great earth 
From the great heaven she set her mind on the great below 
From the great heaven the goddess set her mind on the great below 
My mistress abandoned heaven abandoned earth and descended to the underworld 
Inana abandoned heaven abandoned earth and descended to the underworld 
She abandoned the office of en abandoned the office of lagar and descended to the underworld 
She abandoned the Eanna in Uruk and descended to the underworld

She put a turban headgear for the open country on her head 
She took a wig for her forehead 
She hung small lapislazuli beads around her neck 
She covered her body with a pala dress the garment of ladyship 
She placed mascara Let a man come let him come on her eyes 
She pulled the pectoral Come man come over her breast 
She placed a golden ring on her hand 
She held the lapislazuli measuring rod and measuring line in her hand 
Inanna traveled towards the underworld 
Her minister Ninubur traveled behind her 
Holy Inanna says to Ninubur 
Come my faithful minister of Eanna 
my minister who speaks fair words 
On this day I will descend to the underworld 
When I have arrived in the underworld 
make a lament for me on the ruin mounds 
Beat the drum for me in the sanctuary 
Lacerate your eyes for me lacerate your nose for me 
and all alone set your foot in the Ekur the house of Enlil 
lament before Enlil 
Father Enlil dont let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld 
Dont let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone 
Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood 
Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld 
If Enlil does not help you in this matter go to Ur 
In the Emukura at Ur 
when you have entered the Ekinugal toward Nanna 
lament before Nanna 
Father Nanna dont let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld 
Dont let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld 
Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood 
Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld 
And if Nanna does not help you in this matter go to Eridu 
In Eridu when you have entered the house of Enki 
lament before Enki 
Father Enki dont let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld 
Dont let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone 
Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld 
He is the one who will restore me to life 
Go now my Ninubur and pay attention 
she pushed aggressively on the door of the underworld 
She shouted aggressively at the gate of the underworld 
Open up doorman open up 
Neti the chief doorman of the underworld 
answers holy Inanna 
I am Inanna going to the east 
If you are Inanna going to the east 
why have you traveled to the land of no return 
How did you set your heart on the road whose traveller never returns 
Holy Inanna answers him 
Because lord Gudgalana 
the husband of my elder sister holy Erekigal has died 
she offers generous libations at his wake that is the reason 
Neti the chief doorman of the underworld 
answers holy Inanna 
Stay here Inanna I will speak to my mistress 
Neti the chief doorman of the underworld 
to his mistress Erekigal 
entered the house and said 
My mistress there is a lone girl outside 
It is Inanna your sister and she has arrived at the palace Ganzer 
She pushed aggressively on the door of the underworld 
She shouted aggressively at the gate of the underworld 
She has abandoned Eanna and has descended to the underworld 
She has taken the 7 divine powers 
She has come on her way with all the good divine powers 
She has put a turban headgear for the open country on her head 
She has placed twin eggshaped beads on her breast 
She has covered her body with the pala dress of ladyship 
She has placed mascara Let a man come on her eyes 
She has placed a golden ring on her hand 
She is holding the lapislazuli reed1ninda measuring rod and measuring line in her hand 
When she heard this Erekigal slapped the side of her thigh 
She bit her lip and took the words to heart 
She says to Neti her chief doorman 
Come Neti my chief doorman of the underworld 
dont neglect the instructions I will give you 
Then let each door of the palace Ganzer be opened separately 
and crouched down and had her clothes removed they will be carried away 
Neti the chief doorman of the underworld 
paid attention to the instructions of his mistress 
He bolted the 7 gates of the underworld 
Then he opened each of the doors of the palace Ganzer separately 
He says to holy Inanna 
Come on Inanna and enter 
And when Inanna entered 
the turban headgear for the open country was removed from her head 
What is this 
Be satisfied Inanna a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled 
Inanna you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld 
When she entered the 2nd gate 
the small lapislazuli beads were removed from her neck

Inanna you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld 
After she had crouched down and had her clothes removed they were carried away 
and instead she sat on her throne 
The Anuna the seven judges rendered their decision against her 
They looked at herit was the look of death 
The afflicted woman was turned into a corpse 
And the corpse was hung on a hook 
After 3 days and 3 nights had passed 
her minister Ninubur 
carried out the instructions of her mistress 
She made a lament for her in her ruined houses 
She beat the drum for her in the sanctuaries 
She made the rounds of the houses of the gods for her 
She lacerated her eyes for her she lacerated her nose 
and all alone she set her foot in the Ekur the house of Enlil 
she laments before Enlil 
Dont let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone 
Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood 
In his rage father Enlil answers Ninubur 
My daughter craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well 
Inanna craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well 
Thus father Enlil did not help in this matter so she went to Ur 
In the Emudkura at Ur 
when she had entered the Ekinugal the house of Nanna 
Father Nanna dont let your daughter be killed in the underworld 
Dont let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone 
Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood 
Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld 
In his rage father Nanna answers Ninubur 
Inanna craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well 
The divine powers of the underworld are divine powers which should not be craved for whoever gets them must remain in the underworld 
Who having got to that place could then expect to come up again 
Thus father Nanna did not help her in this matter so she went to Eridu 
In Eridu when she had entered the house of Enki 
xshe laments before Enkixx 
Father Enki dont let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone 
Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood 
Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld 
Father Enki answered Ninubur 
What has Inanna done She has me worried 
What has the mistress of all the lands done She has me worried 
What has the hierodule of An done She has me worried 
He removed some dirt from the tip of his fingernail and created the kurgar 
He removed some dirt from the tip of his 2nd fingernail and created the galatur 
To the kurgar he gave the lifegiving plant 
To the galatura he gave the lifegiving water 
Then father Enki speaks out to the galatura and the kurgar 
Flit past the door like flies 
Slip through the door pivots like phantoms 
The birthmother on account of her children 
Her holy shoulders are not covered by a linen cloth 
Her breasts are not full like a cagan vessel 
The hair on her head is bunched up as if it were leeks 
When she says Oh my heart 
you are to say You are troubled our mistress oh your heart 
When she says Oh my liver 
Speaking to you from my heart to your heart from my liver to your liver 
if you are mortals may a destiny be decreed for you 
Make her swear this by heaven and earth 
Go on out 
They will offer you a riverful of waterdont accept it 
They will offer you a field with its graindont accept it 
But say to her Give us the corpse hanging on the hook 
She will give you the corpse hanging on the hook 
1 of you sprinkle on it the lifegiving plant and 1 the lifegiving water 
Thus let Inanna rise up 
The galatura and the kurgar paid attention to the instructions of Enki 
They flitted through the door like flies 
They slipped through the door pivots like phantoms 
The birthmother because of her children 
Erekigal was lying there 
Her holy shoulders were not covered by a linen cloth 
Her breasts were not full like a cagan vessel 
Her nails were like a pickaxe  upon her 
The hair on her head was bunched up as if it were leeks 
When she said Oh my heart 
they said to her You are troubled our mistress oh your heart 
Then she asked Who are you 
if you are gods I will talk with you 
They made her swear this by heaven and earth 
they went on out 
they were offered a river with its waterthey did not accept it 
They were offered a field with its grainthey did not accept it 
They said to her Give us the corpse hanging on the hook 
Holy Erekigal answers the galatura and the kurgar 
The corpse is that of your queen 
They said to her Whether it is that of our king or that of our queen give it to us 
They were given the corpse hanging on the hook 
1 of them sprinkled on it the lifegiving plant and 1 the lifegiving water 
And thus Inanna rose up 
Erekigal says to the galatura and the kurgar 
Bring your queen  your  has been seized 
Inanna because of Enkis instructions was about to ascend from the underworld 
But as Inanna was about to ascend from the underworld 
the Anuna seized her 
Who has ever ascended from the underworld has ascended unscathed from the underworld 
If Inanna is to ascend from the underworld 
let her provide a substitute for herself 
So when Inanna left the underworld 
the one in front of her though not a minister held a sceptre in his hand 
the one behind her though not an escort carried a mace at his hip 
while the small demons like a reed enclosure 
and the big demons like the reeds of a fence restrained her on all sides 
Those who accompanied her 
those who accompanied Inanna 
know no food know no drink 
and drink no libation 
They accept no pleasant gifts 
They take away the child hanging on a wetnurses breasts 
They eat no fish they eat no leeks 
They it was who accompanied Inanna 
After Inanna had ascended from the underworld 
Ninubur threw herself at her feet at the door of the Ganzer 
She had sat in the dust and clothed herself in a filthy garment 
The demons said to holy Inanna 
Inanna proceed to your city we will take her back 
This is my minister of fair words 
She did not forget my instructions 
She did not neglect the orders I gave her 
She made a lament for me on the ruin mounds 
She beat the drum for me in the sanctuaries 
She lacerated her eyes for me lacerated her nose for me 
To the house of Enlil 
and to Ur to the house of Nanna 
She brought me back to life 
How could I turn her over to you 
ara in his own city threw himself at her feet 
Holy Inanna answered the demons 
my manicurist and my hairdresser 
Let us go on Let us go on to the Emukalama in Badtibira 
At the Emukalama in Badtibira 
Lulal in his own city threw himself at her feet 
He had sat in the dust and clothed himself in a filthy garment 
Inanna proceed to your city we will take him back 
Outstanding Lulal follows me at my right and my left 
How could I turn him over to you 
They followed her to the great apple tree in the plain of Kulaba 
The demons seized him there by his thighs 
The 7 of them poured the milk from his churns 
The seven of them shook their heads like  
She spoke to him  it was the speech of anger 
She shouted at him  it was the shout of heavy guilt 
How much longer Take him away 
Those who had accompanied her 
who had come for Dumuzi 
know no food know no drink 
eat no flour offering 
drink no libation 
They never enjoy the pleasures of the marital embrace 
never have any sweet children to kiss 
They snatch the son from a mans knee 
Dumuzi let out a wail and turned very pale 
I brought cheese to Ningals house 
Turn my hands into snakes hands 
and turn my feet into snakes feet 
so I can escape my demons let them not keep hold of me 
Utu turned Dumuzis hands into snakes hands 
He turned his feet into snakes feet 
Dumuzi escaped his demons 
Holy Inanna  her heart 
Holy Inanna  her heart 
Holy Inanna  her heart 
Holy Inanna wept bitterly for her husband 
 her husband  by force  
 like  
 like  
She tore at her hair like esparto grass she ripped it out like esparto grass 
You children who lie in your mens embrace where is my precious child 
Where is my man Where  
Where is my man Where  
A fly speaks to holy Inanna 
If I show you where your man is what will be my reward 
Holy Inanna answers the fly 
If you show me where my man is I will give you this gift 
I will cover   
The fly helped  holy Inanna 
The young lady Inanna decreed the destiny of the fly 
In the beerhouse and the tavern  may there  for you 
You will live  like the sons of the wise 
Now Inanna decreed this fate and thus it came to be 
 was weeping 
Now alas my  
You for half the year and your sister for half the year 
when you are demanded on that day you will stay 
when your sister is demanded on that day you will be released 
Thus holy Inanna gave Dumuzi as a substitute  
Holy Erekigal

lasted for 1 years 
and following his upbringing he lasted for another 1 years 
However he did not do any work 
He became smaller and smaller  
his sheep died  in the sheepfold 
In those days because the water of Laga was held back 
there was famine in irsu 
Canals were not dug 
the levees and ditches were not cleaned 
The large arable tracts were not  
there was no water to irrigate abundantly all the cultivated fields 
the people relied on rain 
Anan did not make dappled barley grow

None of the countries with numerous people for the gods

In order to dig canals

From the years of AmarSuena 
until King IbbiSuen 
Written according to the words of Luinanna the chief leatherworker of Enlil 
built the storehouse of Enlil 
to  its great furnaces
to see that its canals  waters of joy for eternity
to see that the hoes till the arable tracts and that  the fields
to turn the house of Ki which was like a haunted town into a living settlement again
its king shepherd UrZababa
rose like Utu over the house of Ki
However to alter his term of reigning and to remove the prosperity of the palace
An and Enlil authoritatively  decided  by their holy command
Then Sargon  his city was the city of 
his father was Laibum his mother 
Sargon  with happy heart
One day after the evening had arrived
and Sargon had brought the regular deliveries to the palace
He UrZababa was sleeping and dreaming in the holy bedchamber his holy residence
He realised what the dream was about but did not put into words did not discuss it with anyone
UrZababa appointed him cupbearer putting him in charge of the drinks cupboard
Holy inanna did not cease to stand by him
After five or 1 days had passed
King UrZababa  and became frightened in his residence
Like a lion he urinated sprinkling his legs and the urine contained blood and pus
He was troubled he was disturbed like a fish living in brackish water
It was then that the cupbearer of Ezinas winehouse
Sargon lay down not to sleep but lay down to dream
The sleeping Sargon groaned and gnawed the ground
When King UrZababa heard about this groaning
Sargon was brought into the presence of UrZababa who said
Cupbearer was a dream revealed to you in the night
My king this is my dream which I will tell you about
There was a young woman who was as high as the heavens and as broad as the earth
She was firmly set as the base of a wall
UrZababa chewed his lips he became seriously afraid
He spoke to  his chancellor
My royal sister holy inanna
is going to change  my finger into a  of blood
Belitikal chief smith man of my choosing who can write tablets
I will give you orders let my orders be carried out
Let my advice be followed
Now then when the cupbearer has delivered my bronze handmirror  to you
in the Esikil the fated house throw them the mirror and Sargon into the mould like statues
Belitikal heeded his kings words
and prepared the moulds in the Esikil the fated house
The king spoke to Sargon
Go and deliver my bronze handmirror  to the chief smith
Sargon left the palace of UrZababa
Holy inanna however did not cease to stand at his right hand side
holy inanna turned around toward him and blocked his way saying
The Esikil is a holy house No one polluted with blood should enter it
Thus he met the chief smith of the king only at the gate of the fated house
After he delivered the kings bronze handmirror  to the chief smith
After five or 1 days had passed Sargon
he came into the palace firmly founded like a great mountain
King UrZababa  and became frightened in his residence
He realised what was it about but did not put into words did not discuss it with anyone
UrZababa became frightened in the bedchamber his holy residence
He realised what was it about but did not put into words did not discuss it with anyone
In those days although writing words on tablets existed putting tablets into envelopes did not yet exist
King UrZababa despatched Sargon the creature of the gods
with a message written on clay which was about murdering Sargon
to Lugalzagesi in Uruk
With the wife of Lugalzagesi 
She gave her feminity as a shelter 
Come He directed his steps to brickbuilt Eana
But as soon as he did talk to the envoy 
Alas and sat in the dust
Envoy Sargon does not yield
After he has submittedSargon  Lugalzagesi 
Sargon  Lugalzagesi 
After Enlils frown 
had slain Ki as if it were the Bull of Heaven 
had slaughtered the house of the land of Uruk in the dust as if it were a mighty bull 
Then to Sargon king of Agade 
from the south as far as the highlands did Enlil 
give the rulership and kingship 
at that time holy inanna established the sanctuary of Agade 
she set up her throne in Ulma 
Like a young man building a house for the first time 
So that the warehouses would be provisioned 
that dwellings would be founded in the city 
that its people would eat splendid food 
that its people would drink splendid beverages 
that those bathed for holidays would rejoice in the courtyards 
that the people would throng the places of celebration 
that foreigners would cruise about like unusual birds in the sky 
that even Marhai would be reentered on the tribute rolls 
would jostle each other in the public squares 
as well as thoroughbred dogs lions mountain ibexes and alum sheep with long wool 
holy inanna did not sleep as she ensured all of this 
She then filled Agades stores for emmer wheat with gold 
she filled its stores for white emmer wheat with silver 
She endowed its old women with the gift of giving counsel 
she endowed its old men with the gift of eloquence 
she endowed its young men with martial might 
she endowed its little ones with joy 
The nursemaids who cared for the generals children 
played the drumsticks 
All foreign lands rested contentedly 
and their people experienced happiness 
rose as the daylight on the holy throne of Agade 
Its city wall like a mountain reached the heavens 
Its citygates were like the Tigris going to the sea 
when Inanna opened its portals 
and made Sumer bring its own possessions upstream by boats 
The highland Martu people ignorant of agriculture 
brought spirited cattle and kids for her 
The Meluans the people of the black land 
Elam and Subir loaded themselves with goods for her as if they were packasses 
All the governors the temple administrators 
regularly supplied the monthly and New Year offerings 
What a weariness all these caused at Agades city gates 
Holy inanna could hardly receive all these offerings 
As if she were a citizen there she could not restrain  the desire  to prepare the ground for a temple 
But the statement coming from the Ekur was disquieting 
Because of Enlil  all Agade was reduced  to trembling 
and terror befell inanna in Ulma 
She left the city returning to her home 
Like someone abandoning the young women of her womans domain 
Holy inanna abandoned the sanctuary of Agade 
Like a warrior hurrying to arms 
and handed them over to the enemy 
Not even five or 1 days had passed 
and the jewels of rulership the royal crown 
the emblem and the royal throne bestowed on Agade 
did Ninurta bring back into his Eumea 
Enki took away its wisdom 
Its fearsomeness that reaches heaven 
An took up into the midst of heaven 
Its wellanchored holy mooring pole 
Enki tore out from the abzu 
inanna took away its weapons 
and all the cities were watching it 
Like a mighty elephant it bent its neck to the ground 
while they all raised their horns like mighty bulls 
Like a dying dragon it dragged its head on the earth 
and they jointly deprived it of honour as in a battle 
Enlil would not let the kingdom of Agade occupy a pleasant lasting residence 
that he would make its future altogether unfavourable 
that he would make its temples shake and would scatter its treasures  
 NaramSuen saw that in a nocturnal vision 
He realised what the dream was about but did not put into words and did not discuss it with anyone 
 temples shake  
 perform  extispicy regarding  his temple  
covered his chariot with a reed mat 
tore the reed canopy off his ceremonial barge 
and gave away his royal paraphernalia 
Who has ever seen a king burying his head in his hands for seven years 
He realised what the dream was about but did not put into words and did not discuss it with anyone 
Then he went to perform extispicy on a kid regarding the temple 
but the omen had nothing to say about the building of the temple 
but the omen again had nothing to say about the building of the temple 
In order to change what had been inflicted  upon him 
Because his subjects were dispersed 
he now began a mobilization of his troops 
Like a wrestler who is about to enter the great courtyard 
he  his hands towards  the Ekur 
Like an athlete bent to start a contest 
Like a robber plundering the city 
he set tall ladders against the temple 
To demolish Ekur as if it were a huge ship 
to break up its soil like the soil of mountains where precious metals are mined 
to splinter it like the lapis lazuli mountain 
to prostrate it like a city inundated by Ikur 
alhough the temple was not the Mountains of Cedarfelling 
he had large axes cast 
he had doubleedged agasilig axes sharpened to be used against it 
He set spades against its roots 
and it sank as low as the foundation of the Land 
He put axes against its top 
and the temple like a dead soldier bowed its neck before him 
He ripped out its drain pipes 
and all the rain went back to the heavens 
From its Gate from which Grain is never Diverted he diverted grain 
and the Land was deprived of grain 
He struck the Gate of WellBeing with the pickaxe 
and wellbeing was subverted in all the foreign lands 
As if they were for great tracts of land with wide carpfilled waters 
he cast large spades to be used against the Ekur 
The people could see the bedchamber its room which knows no daylight 
They could look into the holy treasure chest of the gods 
its laama deities of the great pilasters standing at the temple 
though they had committed no sacrilege 
were thrown into the fire by NaramSuen 
The cedar cypress juniper and boxwood 
the woods of its giguna were  by him 
He put its gold in containers 
and put its silver in leather bags 
The silversmiths were reshaping its silver 
smiths were beating its copper 
large ships were moored at the temple 
large ships were moored at Enlils temple 
and its possessions were taken away from the city 
With the possessions being taken away from the city 
As the ships moved away from the docks Agades intelligence was removed 
The roaring storm that subjugates the entire land 
the rising deluge that cannot be confronted 
Enlil was considering what should be destroyed in return for the wrecking of his beloved Ekur 
He lifted his gaze towards the Gubin mountains 
Those who do not resemble other people who are not reckoned as part of the Land 
the Gutians an unbridled people 
with human intelligence but canine instincts and monkeys features  
Enlil brought them out of the mountains 
Like small birds they swooped on the ground in great flocks 
Because of Enlil they stretched their arms out across the plain like a net for animals 
Nothing escaped their clutches 
no one left their grasp 
Messengers no longer travelled the highways 
The Gutians drove the trusty  goats of Enlil out of their folds and compelled their herdsmen to follow them they drove the cows out of their pens and compelled their cowherds to follow them 
Prisoners manned the watch 
Brigands occupied the highways 
The doors of the city gates of the Land lay dislodged in mud 
and all the foreign lands uttered bitter cries from the walls of their cities 
They established gardens for themselves within the cities and not as usual on the wide plain outside 
As if it had been before the time when cities were built and founded 
the large arable tracts yielded no grain 
the inundated tracts yielded no fish 
the irrigated orchards yielded no syrup or wine 
the thick clouds  did not rain the magurum plant did not grow 
In those days oil for one shekel was only half a litre 
grain for one shekel was only half a litre 
wool for one shekel was only one mina 
fish for one shekel filled only one ban measure 
these sold at such prices in the markets of the cities 
Those who lay down on the roof died on the roof 
People were flailing at themselves from hunger 
if two men walked there they would be devoured by them 
and if three men walked there they would be devoured by them 
Noses were punched  heads were smashed  
noses  were piled up heads were sown like seeds 
heroes lay dead on top of heroes 
into small reed  sanctuaries 
and from east to west he reduced their storehouses 
The old women who survived those days 
the old men who survived those days 
and the chief lamentation singer who survived those years 
set up seven bala drums 
ub meze and lilis drums made them resound to Enlil like Ikur 
The old women did not restrain the cry Alas for my city 
The old men did not restrain the cry Alas for its people 
Its young women did not restrain from tearing their hair 
Their laments were as if Enlils ancestors 
At that time Suen Enki inanna Ninurta Ikur Utu Nuska and Nisaba the great gods 
May the one that defiled your giguna be treated as Nibru 
In this city may heads fill the wells 
May no one find his acquaintances there 
may brother not recognise brother 
May its young woman be cruelly killed in her womans domain 
may its old man cry in distress for his slain wife 
May its pigeons moan on their window ledges 
may it live in constant anxiety like a timid pigeon 
and cursed Agade severely 
City you pounced on Ekur it is as if you had pounced on Enlil 
May your holy walls to their highest point resound with mourning 
May your giguna be reduced to a pile of dust 
May your pilasters with the standing lahama deities 
fall to the ground like tall young men drunk on wine 
May your clay be returned to its abzu 
may it be clay cursed by Enki 
May your grain be returned to its furrow 
may it be grain cursed by Ezina 
May your timber be returned to its forest 
may it be timber cursed by Ninilduma 
May the cattle slaughterer slaughter his wife 
May water wash away your pauper as he is looking for  
May your prostitute hang herself at the entrance to her brothel 
may your silver be bought for the price of pyrite  
and may your copper be bought for the price of lead 
Agade may your strong man be deprived of his strength 
so that he will be unable to lift his sack of provisions and  
May this make the city die of hunger 
May your citizens who used to eat fine food lie hungry 
eat the coating on his roof 
The leather hinges on the main door of his fathers house 
may he chew their leather hinges 
May depression descend upon your palace built for joy 
may foxes that frequent its ruin mounds and brush it with their tails 
May the ukuku the bird of depression make its nest in them 
In your city that could not sleep because of the tigi drums 
that could not rest from its joy 
may the bulls of Nanna that fill the pens 
bellow like those who wander in the desert the silent place 
May the grass grow long on your canalbank towpaths 
may the grass of mourning grow on your highways laid for waggons 
Moreover on your towpaths built up with canal sediment 
may  wild rams  and alert snakes of the mountains allow no one to pass 
In your plains where fine grass grows may the reed of lamentation grow 
Agade may brackish water flow where fresh water flowed for you 
And before Utu on that very day so it was 
On its canal bank towpaths the grass grew long 
On its highways laid for waggons the grass of mourning grew 
Moreover on its towpaths built up with canal sediment 
Agades flowing fresh water flowed as brackish water 
When someone decided I will rest in Agade 
Enki took away its wisdom 
An took it up into the midst of heaven 
Its wellanchored holy mooring pole 
Enki tore it out from the abzu 
That he would make its future altogether unfavourable 
that he would make its temples shake and would scatter its treasures  
 NaramSuen saw that in a nocturnal vision 
as if he were to change what had been inflicted  upon him 
His subjects were dispersed 
so he began a mobilization of his troops 
Like a wrestler who is about to enter the great courtyard

In his righteous destroyed city its lament is bitter 
In his destroyed Ur its lament is bitter 
Together with the lord whose house had been devastated his city was given over to tears 
Ur joined the lament 
The good woman to disquiet the lord concerning his city 
Ningal to give him no rest concerning his Land 
approached him for the sake of his city  bitterly she weeps 
She approached him for the sake of his devastated city  bitterly she weeps 
herself utters softly a lamentation for the silent house 
The storm that came to be  its lamentation hangs heavy on me 
I am the woman for whom the storm came to be 
The storm that came to be  
 its lamentation hangs heavy on me 
I trembled on account of that day 
but I did not flee before the days violence 
Because of this debilitating storm I could not see a good day for my rule not one good day for my rule 
trembled on account of that night 
The awesomeness of this storm destructive as the flood truly hangs heavy on me 
Because of its existence in my nightly sleeping place even in my nightly sleeping place truly there was no peace for me 
Nor because of this debilitating storm was the quiet of my sleeping place not even the quiet of my sleeping place allowed to me 
2 mss add 1 line Truly I did not forsake my Land 
Because there was bitterness in my Land 
I trudged the earth like a cow for its calf 
My Land was not granted success 
I beat my wings like a bird of heaven 
and flew to my city 
and my city was destroyed in its foundations 
Because the hand of the storm appeared above 
I screamed and cried to it Return O storm to the plain 
The storms breast did not rise 
To me the woman in the Agrunkug my house of queenship 
they did not grant a reign of distant days 
As for the house which used to be where the spirit of the blackheaded people was soothed 
instead of its festivals wrath and terror indeed multiply 
Because of this debilitating storm into my house the favourable place 
my devastated righteous house upon which no eye had been cast 
depression and lament and bitterness 
lament and bitterness have been brought into it 
My house founded by the righteous 
was pushed over on its side like a garden fence 
the good house my house which has been given over to tears 
its building falsely and its perishing truly  
they granted this to me as its lot and share 
As onto a tent a shelter on the denuded harvest ground 
Ur my allsurpassing chamber 
the house and the smitten city all have been uprooted 
Like a shepherds sheepfold it has been uprooted 
The swamp has swallowed my possessions accumulated in the city 
3rd kirugu 
Ur has been given over to tears 
On that day when such a storm had pounded 
when in the presence of the queen her city had been destroyed 
when they had pronounced the utter destruction of my city 
when they had pronounced the utter destruction of Ur 
on that day I did not abandon my city 
I did not forsake my land 
Truly I shed my tears before An 
Truly I myself made supplication to Enlil 
Let not my city be destroyed I implored them 
Let not Ur be destroyed I implored them 
Let not its people perish I implored them 
Enlil did not soothe my heart with an It is good  so be it 
A second time when the council had settled itself in the preeminent place 
and the Anuna had seated themselves to ratify decisions 
I prostrated  myself and stretched out my arms 
Truly I shed my tears before An 
Truly I myself made supplication to Enlil 
Let not Ur be destroyed I implored them 
Let not its people perish I implored them 
But An did not change that word 
They gave instructions that my city should be utterly destroyed 
They gave instructions that Ur should be utterly destroyed 
They decreed its destiny that its people should be killed 
In return for the speech  which I had given them 
and Enlil does not alter what he has uttered

The storm that annihilates the Land roars below  the people groan 
The evil wind like a rushing torrent cannot be restrained 
The weapons in the city smash heads and consume indiscriminately 
The storm whirled gloom around the base of the horizon  the people groan 
In front of the storm heat blazes  the people groan 
A fiery glow burns with the raging storm 
After the haze had lifted at noon he made fires blaze 
He locked up the day and the rising of the bright sun together with the good storm 
In the Land he did not let the bright sun rise it shone like the evening star 
n the delightful night the time when coolness sets in he redoubled the south wind 
He swept the winds over the blackheaded people  the people groan 
Sumer was overturned by a snare  the people groan 
It attacked  the Land and devoured it completely 
Tears cannot influence the bitter storm  the people groan 
The reaping storm dragged across the Land 
The storm that annihilates the Land silenced the city 
The storm that will make anything vanish came doing evil 
The storm ordered by Enlil in hate the storm which wears away the Land 
covered Ur like a garment was spread out over it like linen

Then the storm was taken from the Land  the people groan 
2 mss add 1 line The good storm was taken from Sumer  the people groan 
Its people littered its outskirts just as if they might have been broken potsherds 
Breaches had been made in its walls  the people groan 
On its lofty citygates where walks had been taken corpses were piled 
On its boulevards where festivals had been held heads lay scattered  
In all its streets where walks had been taken corpses were piled 
In its places where the dances of the Land had taken place people were stacked in heaps 
They made the blood of the Land flow down the wadis like copper or tin 
Its corpses like fat left in the sun melted away of themselves 
The heads of its men slain by the axe were not covered with a cloth 
Like a gazelle caught in a trap their mouths bit the dust 
Men struck down by the spear were not bound with bandages 
As if in the place where their mothers had laboured they lay in their own blood 
Its men who were finished off by the battlemace were not bandaged with new  cloth 
Although they were not drunk with strong drink their necks drooped on their shoulders 
He who stood up to the weapon was crushed by the weapon  the people groan 
He who ran away from it was overwhelmed  by the storm  the people groan 
Mothers and fathers who did not leave their houses were consumed by fire 
The little ones lying in their mothers arms were carried off like fish by the waters 
Among the nursemaids with their strong embrace the embrace was pried open 
The Lands judgment disappeared  the people groan 
The mother absconded before her childs eyes  the people groan 
The father turned away from his child  the people groan 
In the city the wife was abandoned the child was abandoned possessions were scattered about 
The blackheaded people were carried off from their strongholds 
Its queen like a bird in fright departed from her city 
All the treasures accumulated in the Land were defiled 
In all the storehouses abounding in the Land fires were kindled 
In its ponds Gibil the purifier relentlessly did his work 
The good house of the lofty untouchable mountain Ekinugal 
was entirely devoured by large axes 
The people of imaki and Elam the destroyers counted its worth as only thirty shekels 
They reduced the city to ruin mounds 
Its queen cried Alas my city cried Alas my house

My houses of the outer city were destroyed  I shall cry Alas my houses 
My city no longer multiplies for me like good ewes its good shepherd is gone 
My bull no longer crouches in its cowpen its herdsman is gone 
In the river of my city dust has gathered and the holes of foxes have been dug there 
In its midst no flowing water is carried its taxcollector is gone 
In the fields of my city there is no grain their farmer is gone 
My fields like fields from which the hoe has been kept away  have grown tangled  weeds 
My orchards and gardens that produced abundant syrup and wine have grown mountain thornbushes 
My plain that used to be covered in its luxurious verdure has become cracked  like a kiln 
My possessions like a flock of rooks rising up have risen in flight  I shall cry O my possessions

Men ignorant of gems have fastened my gems around their necks 
My small birds and fowl have flown away  I shall say Alas my city

Lightning carried off your fowler who was carrying birds  how long will this last

The orchards were stripped of their fruit they were cleaned of their offshoots 
The crop drowned while it was still on the stalk 
They piled  up in heaps they spread  out like sheaves

The tiara and crown that had been on the kings head were both spoiled 
The lands that had followed the same path were split into disunity 
The food offerings of Ur the shrine of magnificent food offerings were changed for the worse 
Nanna traded away his people numerous as ewes

Dumuzidabzu was full of fear in the house of Kinira 
Kinira the city to which she belongs was ordered to be plundered 
Sirara her beloved dwelling was handed over to the evil ones 
Alas the destroyed city my destroyed house 
Its sacred ipar of en priesthood was defiled 
Its en priest was snatched from the ipar and carried off to enemy territory 
Mighty strength was set against the banks of the IdnunaNanna canal 
The settlements of the Edanna of Nanna like substantial cattlepens were destroyed 
Their refugees like stampeding goats were chased  by dogs 
They destroyed Gae like milk poured out to dogs 
and shattered its finely fashioned statues 
Alas the destroyed city my destroyed house 
A lament was raised at the dais that stretches out toward heaven 
Its heavenly throne was not set up was not fit to be crowned  
It was cut down as if it were a date palm and tied together 
Au the settlement that stretches out along the river was deprived of water 
At the place of Nanna where evil had never walked the enemy walked 
How was the house treated thus 
The Epuruma was emptied 
KiNUNMEDU which used to be filled with numerous cows and numerous calves was destroyed like a mighty cattlepen 
Ningublaga took an unfamiliar path away from the abura 
Ninigara wept bitter tears all alone 
Alas the destroyed city my destroyed house 
Its sacred ipar of en priesthood was defiled 
Ninazu deposited his weapon in a corner in the Egida 
An evil storm swept over Ninursaga at the Enutura 
Like a pigeon she flew from the window she stood apart in the open country 
Alas the destroyed city my destroyed house 
As for ibanda the house filled with lamentation was destroyed among the weeping reeds 
Ningizida took an unfamiliar path away from ibanda 
Azimua the queen of the city wept bitter tears 
Alas the destroyed city my destroyed house 
On that day the storm forced people to live in darkness 
In order to destroy Kuara it forced people to live in darkness 
Nineama in her fear wept bitter tears 
Alas the destroyed city my destroyed house 
Asarlui put his robes on with haste and  
Lugalbanda took an unfamiliar path away from his beloved dwelling 
1 ms adds Ninsumun  
In its outer environs which had turned into haunted plains  
We have been struck down like beautiful boxwood trees 
We have been struck down like statues being cast in moulds 
The Gutians the vandals are wiping us out 
 whatever we shall say whatever we shall add 
 whatever we shall say whatever we shall add 
While were in charge of  during the day the shadows  
While we were in charge of  during the night the storm  
Enki your city has been cursed it has been given to an enemy land 
Why do they reckon us among those who have been displaced from Eridug 
Why do they destroy us like palm trees which we have not tended 
Why do they break us up like new boats we have not caulked 
After Enki had cast his eyes on a foreign land 
 have risen up have called on their cohorts 
 have risen up have called on their cohorts 
Enki took an unfamiliar path away from Eridug 
Damgalnuna the mother of the Ema wept bitter tears 
Alas the destroyed city my destroyed house 
Its en priestess was snatched from the ipar and carried off to enemy territory 
In Ur no one went to fetch food no one went to fetch water 
Those who went to fetch food went away from the food and will not return 
Those who went to fetch water went away from the water and will not return 
To the south the Elamites stepped in slaughtering  
In the uplands the vandals the enemy  
The Tidnum daily strapped the mace to their loins 
To the south the Elamites like an onrushing wave were  
This is what Enlil who decides the fates did 
Again he sent down the Elamites the enemy from the mountains 
In order to destroy Kisiga 1 men even five men  
Three days and three nights did not pass  the city was raked by a hoe 
Dumuzid left Kisiga like a prisoner of war his hands were fettered 
To the holy house  
She rode away from her possessions she went to the mountains 
She rode away from her possessions she went to the mountains 
She rode away from her possessions she went to the mountains 
She rode away from her possessions she went to the mountains 
She rode away from her possessions she went to the mountains 
I am queen but I shall have to ride away from my possessions and now I shall be a slave in those parts 
I shall have to ride away from my silver and lapis lazuli and now I shall be a slave in those parts 
There slavery  people who can  it 
There slavery Elam  who can  it 
Amauumgalana  Kisiga

Enlil threw open the door of the grand gate to the wind 
Enlil threw open the door of the grand gate to the wind 
In Ur no one went to fetch food no one went to fetch water 
Its people rushed around like water being poured from a well 
Their strength ebbed away they could not even go on their way 
Enlil afflicted the city with an evil famine 
He afflicted the city with that which cannot be withstood with weapons 
He afflicted the city with dissatisfaction and treachery 
Its people like fish being grabbed in a pond sought to escape 
Its young and old lay spread about no one could rise 
At the royal station  there was no food on top of the platform  
The king who used to eat marvellous food grabbed at a mere ration 
There was no beer in the beerhall there was no more malt for it 
There was no food for him in his palace it was unsuitable to live in 
Grain did not fill his lofty storehouse he could not save his life 
The grainpiles and granaries of Nanna held no grain 
Wine and syrup ceased to flow in the great dining hall 
The butchers knife that used to slay oxen and sheep lay hungry 
Its mighty oven no longer cooked oxen and sheep it no longer emitted the aroma of roasting meat 
The sounds of the bursag building the pure  of Nanna were stilled 
The house which used to bellow like a bull was silenced 
Its holy deliveries were no longer fulfilled its  were alienated 
The Shining Quay of Nanna was silted up 
The sound of water against the boats prow ceased there was no rejoicing 
Dust piled up in the unuribanda of Nanna 
The rushes grew the rushes grew the mourning reeds grew 
Boats and barges ceased docking at the Shining Quay 
Nothing moved on your watercourse which was fit for barges 
The plans of the festivals at the place of the divine rituals were altered 
The boat with firstfruit offerings of the father who begot Nanna no longer brought firstfruit offerings 
Its food offerings could not be taken to Enlil in Nibru 
Its watercourse was empty barges could not travel 
The reed fence of the wellstocked cattlepen of Nanna was split open 
The gardens fence was vioilated and breached 
The cows and their young were captured and carried off to enemy territory 
The munzerfed cows took an unfamiliar path in an open country that they did not know 
Gayau who loves cows dropped his weapon in the dung 
unidug who stores butter and cheese did not store butter and cheese 
Those who are unfamiliar with butter were churning the butter 
The sound of the churning vat did not resound in the cattlepen 
Like mighty coals that once burnt its smoke is extinguished 
The great dining hall of Nanna  
Suen wept to his father Enlil 
O father who begot me why have you turned away from my city which was built  for you 
O Enlil why have you turned away from my Ur which was built  for you 
The boat with firstfruit offerings no longer brings firstfruit offerings to the father who begot him 
Your food offerings can no longer be brought to Enlil in Nibru 
The en priests of the countryside and city have been carried off by phantoms 
Ur like a city raked by a hoe is to be counted as a ruinmound 
O Enlil gaze upon your city an empty wasteland 
The dogs of Ur no longer sniff at the base of the city wall 
The man who used to drill large wells scratches the ground in the market place 
My father who begot me enclose in your embrace my city which is all alone 
Enlil return to your embrace my Ur which is all alone 
Enclose in your embrace my Ekinugal which is all alone 
May you bring forth offspring in Ur may you multiply its people 
May you restore the divine powers of Sumer that have been forgotten

Enlil then answered his son Suen 
1 ms adds 1 line In its midst there is lamentation reeds of mourning grow there 
In its midst the people pass their days in sighing 
1 ms adds 1 line My son the noble son  why do you concern yourself with crying 
Oh Nanna the noble son  why do you concern yourself with crying 
The judgment uttered by the assembly cannot be reversed 
The word of An and Enlil knows no overturning 
Ur was indeed given kingship but it was not given an eternal reign 
From time immemorial since the Land was founded until people multiplied 
who has ever seen a reign of kingship that would take precedence for ever 
The reign of its kingship had been long indeed but had to exhaust itself 
O my Nanna do not exert yourself in vain abandon your city 
Then my king the noble son became distraught 
Lord Aimbabbar the noble son grieved 
Nanna who loves his city left his city 
In order to go as an exile from her city to foreign territory 
Ningal quickly clothed herself and left the city 
The trees of Ur were sick its reeds were sick 
Laments sounded all along its city wall 
Daily there was slaughter before it 
The spears the arms of battle were prepared 
The large bows throwsticks and shields gathered together to strike 
The barbed arrows covered its outer side like a raining cloud 
Large stones fell toegether with great thuds 
1 ms adds 1 line Daily the evil wind returned in the city 
Ur confident in its own strength stood ready for the murderers 
In the city those who had not been felled by weapons succumbed to hunger 
Hunger filled the city like water it would not cease 
This hunger contorted peoples faces twisted their muscles 
Its people were as if drowning in a pond they gasped for breath 
Its king breathed heavily in his own palace 
Its people dropped their weapons their weapons hit the ground 
They sought counsel with each other they searched for clarification 
Alas what can we say about it What more can we add to it 
How long until we are finished off by this catastrophe 
Inside Ur there is death outside it there is death 
In Ur the enemy oppresses us oh we are finished 
The people took refuge  behind the city walls They were united in fear 
Elam like a swelling flood wave left  only the ghosts 
Its refugees were unable to flee they were trapped inside the walls 
The enemy seized the Ekinugal of Nanna 
They ripped out its heavy  
The statues that were in the shrine were cut down 
Its throne was cast down before it she threw herself down into the dust 
Its mighty cows with shining horns were captured their horns were cut off 
Its unblemished oxen and grassfed sheep were slaughtered 
1 ms adds 1 line They were cut down as date palms and were tied together 
The palmtrees strong as mighty copper the heroic strength 
Their tops lay in the dust there was no one to raise them 
The midribs of their palm fronds were cut off and their tops were burnt off 
Their date spadices that used to fall  on the well were torn out 
The fertile reeds which grew in the sacred  were defiled 
The great tribute that they had collected was hauled off to the mountains 
The wild animals that were intertwined on its left and right 
lay before it like heroes smitten by heroes 
were pulled down with ropes like captured wild bulls and carried off to enemy territory 
The fragrance of the sacred seat of Nanna formerly like a fragrant cedar grove was destroyed 
1 ms adds 1 line Its architrave  gold and lapis lazuli 
The glory of the house whose glory was once so lovely was extinguished 
Like a storm that fills all the lands it was built there like twilight in the heavens 
its  Great bronze latches  were torn out 
Its hinges  Together with its door fittings it  wept bitterly like a fugitive 
The noise of the door being fastened had ceased 
there was no one to fasten it 
The  and was put out in the square 
The food offerings  of his royal dining place were altered 
In its sacred place  the tigi em and ala instruments did not sound 
Its mighty tigi  did not perform its sacred song 
The throne was not set up at its place of judgment justice was not administered 
Alamu threw down his sceptre his hands trembling 
In the sacred bedchamber of Nanna musicians no longer played the balag drum 
The sacred box that no one had set eyes upon was seen by the enemy 
The divine bed was not set up it was not spread with clean hay 
The statues that were in the shrine were cut down 
They stood by submissively and were carried off by the foreigners 
The priests of the holy uzga shrine and the sacred lustrations the linenclad priests 
forsook the divine plans and sacred divine powers they went off to a foreign city 
He went down on his knee in front of Enlil the father who begot him 
he lordship and the kingship that you bestowed  
Father Enlil the one who advises with just words 
the wise words of the Land  
O Father Enlil the fate that you have decreed cannot be explained 
 he put on a garment of mourning 
Enlil then provided a favourable response to his son Suen 
Destroying the city overthrowing its great wall and battlements all this too is part of that reign 
 the black black days of the reign that has been your lot 
As for dwelling in your home the Etemenniguru that was properly built  
 indeed Ur shall be rebuilt in splendour the people shall bow down to you 
There is to be splendour at its top the sun shall rejoice there 
May Ur the city whose fate was pronounced by An be restored for you 
Having pronounced his blessing Enlil raised his head toward the heavens 
May the land south and highland be organised for Nanna 
May the roads of the mountains be set in order for Suen 
Like a cloud hugging the earth they shall submit to him 
By order of An and Enlil it shall be conferred 
Father Nanna came into his city of Ur with head raised high 
The youth Suen could enter again into the Ekinugal 
Ningal refreshed herself in her sacred living quarters

After the cattle pen had been built for the foremost divine powers  
 how did it become a haunted place When will it be restored 
Where once the brick of fate had been laid  
how did the storeroom of Nibru the shrine Duranki 
become a haunted place When will it be restored 
After Kiur the great place had been built 
after the brickwork of Ekur had been built 
after Ubuukkena had been built 
after the shrine Egalma had been built  
 how did they become haunted When will they be restored 
How did the true city become empty 
Its precious designs have been defiled 
How were the citys festivals neglected 
and the blackheaded people prolificly multiplied 
 there where the Anuna used to give advice 
In Ubuukkena the place for making great judgments 
they no longer impart decisions or justice 
Where its gods had established their dwellings 
where the sacred royal offering  and the evening meal in their great banquet hall 
were destined for the pouring out of choice beer and syrup  
 Nibru the city where in its spreading shade 
the blackheaded people used to cool themselves  
 in their dwellings Enlil fell upon them as if they were criminals 
It was he who sent them scattering like a scattered herd of cattle 
The inner city whose bitter tears were overwhelming 
How long until its lady the goddess Ninlil would ask after it 
That great temple whose bustle of activity was famous 
As for all the great rulers who increased the wealth of the city of Nibru  why did they disappear 
Where the blackheaded people ate rich grass like sheep 
For how long would Enlil neglect that Land ears lamentation depression and despair 
How long would his spirit burn and his heart not be placated 
Why were those who once played the em and ala drums 
spending their time in bitter lamenting 
Why were the lamenters sitting in its brick buildings 
They were bewailing the hardship which beset them 
The men whose wives had fallen whose children had fallen 
were singing Oh our destroyed city 
Their city gone their homes abandoned  
 as those who were singing for the brick buildings of the good city 
as the lamenters of wailing 
like the fosterchildren of an ecstatic no longer knowing their own intelligence 
the people were smitten their minds thrown into disorder 
The true temple wails bitterly 
built the temple Ninlil 
Its gigigal 
The true temple gave you only tears and lamentation  
 it sings a bitter song of the proper cleansingrites that are forgotten 
The brickwork of Ekur gave you only tears and lamentation  
 it sings a bitter song of the proper cleansingrites that are forgotten 
Because the sealings of the abundant materials stored in the temple have been broken open they have placed the loads on the ground 
Because the property in its welltended storehouses has been sent back it says What will they weigh out for me now 
because the enemies who do not know good from evil have cut off all good things it sings a bitter dirge 
because they have finished off its populace there like animals it cries Oh my Land 
Because they have piled up the young women young men and their little children like heaps of grain it cries Woe for them 
Because they have splashed their blood on the ground like a rainstorm there is no restraint to its crying 
In anguish they bewail the fact that the citys lord has smashed heads there 
that he has looked away from it and toward a foreign land instead 
The true temple of all the countries which had come before him  
the blackheaded people who had taken a true path 
that their lord has become enraged with them and walks in anger 
2nd kirugu 
It voices bitter cries because he has removed the great divine powers from within it 
Its gigigal 
The citys lord who became angry with it 
How long will he not turn to it not say Alas for it 
Why did he cut off the road to its brickwork 
He made the noisy pigeons fly away from their windows 
Why did he transform the appearance of the temple which knew voices where they used to while away the days in sweet playing of tigi drums in the brick buildings 
The temple once a place to offer salutations in humility 
is now as deathly silent as a temple which no one reveres 
As though its purification priests equipment were not utterly sacred 
as though its cleansingrites did not bring calm in all countries 
among dejection and lamentation he has made it a sacrilege 
After its fate how long till his face would be streaked with teardrops 
He rejected it thus as though it were a blasphemy 
Night and day he has filled its heart with tears 
has destroyed that city and its temples 
killed wives and their children within it 
Its possessions have been carried off by the wind 
Enlil turned the city which used to be there into a city no longer 
He made its mind wander 
He threw its intelligence into disorder and made it haunted 
He took away its food and its water 
He brought to an end its days of familiarity with milk and with beer 
The temple which he has made a sacrilege utters bitter lamentations 
he has made its eyes blurred with tears 
The lamenters who perform the dirges 
The citys lord who has removed its divine powers  
no one touches his arm no one intercedes 
How did Enlil make all his greatest divine powers fly away 
Its gigigal 
To my dirge singer of bitter fates 
I am going down and I shall weep tearfully to him 
Even now the lamenters who are expert in song 
make ululating wails over me 
Now my people who are overcome by hardship 
voice laments for me one by one 
Even now the places of refuge of my people whose hearts are burning in dark distress 
were falsely founded and they have been eroded by the winds 
They are making a lament 
They are beginning their laments about my lord 
He will have mercy and compassion on me  
Enlil father of the blackheaded people 
he who will give the order to restore me 
4th kirugu 
My heart is dark I am destroyed I am in chaos I have been devastated

Say Why  
Say May your heart be soothed for me  overturn this sacrilege for your own good The day is  
Say Reenter for me your dwelling in my darkened shrines 
Say Like a bright cleansed sacred day give  for your own good 
Say  
Say Your misfortunes  will rebuild it 
Perhaps by this means I can make him have compassion and mercy for you 
He will fix it forever as your lot that you shall lift your head high 
he will make good again the hostilities he is directing against you 
Even now your lord has smitten the enemy fury for you 
He has had mercy on you and decreed your fate 
He has said Enough so that he has removed lamentation from your brick buildings 
In good mood and with a joyful heart he has entered in there again for you 
Ninurta the mighty commissioner has looked after things 
He stood there before the hero 
his provider ImeDagan and issued the command to him to completely rebuild the Ekur the most precious shrine 
He has restored its ancient property 
to restore its ziggurat temple to make it shine like the day 
to make fitting the dais upon its platform 
along with the scattered divine powers 
The cleansingrites which the enemy had put a stop to 
so that they should sanctify and purify again 
he has given him his sacred unchangeable decision 
When decrees the fate of the sacred royal offering place  he will offer salutations 
and stand there daily in supplication and prayer 
Your bitter tears 
Your bitter tears

 he who mulled things over so that he came to a decision about them 
Enlil who found agreeable his command of true words 
 he himself is removing what he turned upon you in distress 
Just as he silenced you when he made joy enter again 
he decreed as your fate the sound of choice beer and syrup being poured out to overflowing 
Enough It is time to stifle the lament he said to you himself 
has said My city you have placated my sacred heart towards you He has returned to you 
Nibru you have placated my sacred heart towards you He has returned to you 
True city he has decreed your great fate and made your reign long 
Nibru he has decreed your great fate and made your reign long 
Enlil himself has commanded ImeDagan that the Ekur should shine like the day 
Steady sunlight shines into the Kiur he has brought daylight in there again for you

They have gathered back together the children whom they turned away from their mothers

How you suffer How depression exhausts you 
Even now they command ImeDagan that Sumer and Akkad should be restored at your feet 
that their scattered people should be returned to their nests 
They have brought the news that the magnificent rites of Eridug would not be forgotten 
Adab the city whose lady fashions living things who promotes birthing 
The Anuna the lords who decree fates order that it should be rebuilt 
Ur founded in a pasture its divine powers distinct from the rest 
An and Enlil have advised that it should be restored 
UrukKulaba the sacred city the handiwork of the gods 
They have taken a decision concerning it and restored it 
from the region of zabala the city where the mistress of heaven concentrated her forces 
An and Enlil have looked with their beneficent gaze 
From that temple in Umma egkuraga which had been ill treated 
Ki at the edge of Sumer and Akkad its dominion superlative 
It is the great gods who have commanded that its foundations should be secured 
Marda the city in whose river water flows in whose fields is fine grain  
 the Anuna who took those things away from it returned them to it again 
Isin the provisioner of the Anuna rising high since times of old  
By their command they have handed it over and expressed their approval 
They have entrusted it to Ninurta the champion the strong hero 
Ninisina the exalted child of An the incantation priest of the Land 
they have told to rest calmly in her sacred dwelling Egalma 
Damu the chief barber of Nunamnir healer of the living

He himself has raised up the day for the Kiurs magnificent manifestation 
He himself has restored the day for Sumer and Akkad to expand 
He himself has set aside the day for houses to be built and storerooms to be enclosed 
He himself has brought out the day for seeds to sprout and living things to be born 
He has brought out the day for building cattle pens and founding sheepfolds 
he ewes which bore lambs have filled the pens 
Ewes have given birth in the folds their lambs have filled the pens 
The goats which bore kids have filled the folds 
The ewes which flocked with their lambs have swelled the sheepfold 
The goats which flocked with their kids have caused the pens to be widened 
He himself has set the day for turning destruction to the good 
He has  the day  evil 
He has brought in ImeDagan as assistance for the day for establishing justice in the land 
Although Sumer and Akkad had been desecrated by the foe 
afterwards hearts were appeased spirits soothed 
All the great gods thus had compassion 
They looked upon those sunk in exhaustion and brought them up out of it 
They restored your city which had been razed to ruins 
Its shining property which had been scattered which had been devastated 
in Nibru the mountain of the greatest divine powers from where they had taken an unfamiliar path  
at Enlils word the Anuna those very lords who determine the fates ordered that the temples which they had forsaken 
should all be restored 
He has established there dining in joy within 
To ImeDagan his joyous reverent sacral officiant 
to sanctify its food to purify its water Enlil has given the command to him 
He has put in order its disordered and scattered rites 
He decrees as a fate the offering of daily rations and the grinding up of fine meal and flour 
He has decided to make bread plentiful on the table to make loaves numerous

has fixed it among the blackheaded people and commanded for their benefit 
11th kirugu 
Now see After that time Enlil the prince who is full of pity 
has been beneficent to his hero who had laid the  brick 
He sanctified again the defiled rites for him 
Within he made abundance plentiful he filled it with choice beer and syrup 
He established there at that time the pleasing of hearts the appeasing of spirits the ameliorating of moods 
ImeDagan himself stood in prayer to Enlil and offered salutations 
When he had begun the lament and spoken the supplication 
the prince of all countries treated his body with oil of abundance as if it were the sweetest syrup 
ImeDagan whose words bring Enlil pleasure 
Enlils constant attendant with whose thoughts he agrees 
Because the humble one prostrated himself in his devotions and served there 
because he will complete and honour the royal offering and will return 
because he will keep watch over everything and will not be negligent 
Enlil has promised to ImeDagan his dominion of extended years 
He promised him that he will be a man of preeminent kingship 
He promised him that he will be a king whose reign is good 
He promised him that he shall have the people inhabit safe dwellings 
Enlil found agreement in what he had said to the numerous people 
On the day for decreeing fates every part of Sumer and Akkad 
mong the blackheaded people flocking like sheep among their welltended people 
will praise forever the majesty of the Great Mountain Nunamnir enkar weapon of the universe 
It is his aweinspiring way 
12th kirugu 
The  of heaven and earth put their divine powers  to sleep  
 mortal man multiplied to become as numerous as the gods 
When together  had achieved a momentous decision 
 the  of the gods  
Enki and Ninki determined the consensus  
Enul and Ninul assigned the fate  
When together An and Enlil had created it that one resembled  
When Ninlil had given it features that one was fit for  
When together Aruru Suen and Enki had fashioned its limbs 
All the great gods paled at its immensity and  was brought about 
Like a great wild bull which bellows mightily that one filled the world with its roar 
As it was piled up over the mountains like a battlenet who turned away 
Who caused wailing and lamenting in those streets and  
Uruk like a loyal citizen in terror set up an alarm 
and exclaimed Rise up Why did its hand seize Uruk Why did the benevolent eye look away 
Who brought about such worry and lamenting and  
That one drew nearer That one settled upon the ground Why would he withdraw 
Who distorted Uruks good sense and deranged its good counsel 
Who smashed its good udug deity Who struck its good lamma deity too 
Who desecrated the fearsome radiance which crowned it 
Who brought about mob panic in Uruk Who  sickness too 
Along with the city the foreign lands  who  in the temple of Uruk 
That one  
Who made  
Why was  expanded Who made the blackheaded people become so numerous 
 was destroyed  who restored  
Who confronted  
That one crushed  
That one  
 like  
 and Utu who in human form renders judgment at the law court of heaven set and did not rise again 
 bore a heavy burden of sin 
 the altered verdicts of Lord Nunamnir 
who can smite  
 and they approach  
 of Enlil  
He  and puts an end to  
 each and every one  
 its ways were  
its destruction and demolition  
The  of the gods  attention 
 who neglected  
 the city watched as the evil ghost approached 
He consoled himself with tears and laments  the city trembled 
The fearsome radiance overwhelmed like  
The proud city of all the lands became like one who spreads havoc 
They built them up like grain heaps they spread them out like grain piles 
they were convulsed  they drenched the fields with water they turned the city into a swamp 
They did all that Like reeds in a wasteland life could not be revived 
They brought ruination Evil things menaced  the city 
Its good udug deities went away its lamma deities ran off 
The citys patron god turned against it and its shepherd abandoned it 
Its guardian spirit though not an enemy was exiled  to a foreign place 
Thus all its most important gods evacuated Uruk they kept away from it 
They hid out in the hills and wandered  about in the haunted plains 
In the city built upon peace food and drink were overturned like a saman vessel 
Elderly people and babies taking their rest  in front  
They saw  and slaughtered   
He  and opened his clenched fist 
He  and reached out his hand 
The  of Sumer the city whose king crossed over to an enemy land 
He  and turned the place into dust 
He  and piled the people up in heaps 
 how long until its charms are restored 
2nd kirugu 
The  of heaven  and the people  to the limits of heaven 
Its gigigal 
He  stretched forth his hand and induced terror in the land 
Enlil struck out with great ferocity He announced 
At its front war shall be a  axe at its rear it shall be a  
The glint of its eyes shall be lightning that flashes far like the Anzud bird 
Its mouth shall rage  a blazing fire that extends as far as the nether world 
Its tongue shall be an inferno raining embers that sunders the Land 
Its arms shall be the majestic Anzud bird that nothing can escape when it spreads wide its talons 
Its ribs shall be crowbars that let light pass inside like the suns rays 
Knotted at both its hips shall be citydestroying slingstones 
Its muscles shall be saws that slash its feet those of an eagle 
It shall make the Tigris and Euphrates quaver it shall make the mountains rumble 
At its reverberation the hills shall be uprooted the people shall be pitched about like sheaves 
Sumer and Akkad shall shiver they shall be flooded like a harvest crop 
The foolish shall rejoice they shall exclaim  
Let it come  we shall be seeing war and battle in the city 
how the sacred precinct  is destroyed how the walls are battered down how the citys peace is disrupted 
how among the loyal families honest men are transformed into traitors 
But the sensible shall beat their breasts and droop  their heads 
At midnight they shall be afraid and tearful and suffer insomnia 
In bed under the covers they shall be unable to sleep soundly they shall wander about the city 
They shall be immobilised their courage shall run out 
May our allies serving in times of war raise their forces for peace 
May the word of Enlil be sent back may it turn tail 
May the venom of Nunamnirs anger become exhausted 
3rd kirugu 
My heart is filled with sorrow I am tearstricken 
The word of An having been assigned its place has destroyed the sacred precinct  
The pronouncement of Enlil having been set in motion  
The deluge dashing the hoe to the ground  
The great and fierce  Lord Nergal 
 like Gibil Nergal  
War  enemy lands  echoed 
Like arrows in a quiver  
Gutium the enemy overturned  
Sumer caught in a trap  
ts people were thrown into turmoil  
he mighty heroes of Sumer  
 the heart of a hurricane  
They advanced like the front rank of troops  
Like  they were crushed every one of them  
The troop leaders the most outstanding of the men were viciously hewn down 
Gutium the enemy  weapons  
Like a swelling flood like  Subir poured into Sumer 
They  like stampeding goats they tore apart the corpses of the population 
They mutilated Sumer and Akkad they pulverised it as with a pestle 
They destroyed its settlements and habitations they razed them to ruin mounds 
The best of Sumer they scattered like dust they heaped up  
They massacred its populace they finished off young and old alike 
They destroyed the city of the Anuna gods they set it aflame 
hey put out both Uruks eyes they uprooted its young shoots 
They wandered all through the libation places of the Anuna gods 
And even Kulaba which is the primeval city they turned into a place of murder 
4th kirugu 
Alas  Sumer Alas  its people 
Its gigigal 
At Uruk shouts rang out screams reverberated its captured men  
To the right and left no people moved about no habitations were built 
There was no  and the mobilisation of troops did not  
 rose up to heaven Heaven perished and its strength did not  
 upon the earth The earth was scattered and it did not  
All the settlements were dispersed  Uruk stood all alone 
All night and even until midday battle was waged and afterwards it did not  
Battering rams and shields were set up they rent its walls 
They breached its buttresses they hewed the city with axes 
They set fire to its stations they  the citys dwellings 
They destroyed it they demolished it 
Uruk the good place was  with dust 
Like a wild cow pierced with a spear  
The mighty one rushed with his weapons and  implements of war 
They trampled  through the streets and  
They let the blood of the people flow like that of a sacrificial cow they tore out everything that had been built 
The citizens of Uruk  
They seized  
They demolished  
They set up  
They heaped up  
They put an end to  and did not leave behind  
 Subir entered

As for everything that happened to Sumer and Akkad 
which he has witnessed in Uruk the aggrieved place 
may the most knowledgeable cantors perform songs there 
If the Anuna gods emerge tearfully 
let them promise to us that as it was when heaven and earth came about 
nothing of that time shall be changed 
If An looks kindly upon that man and at the wellbuilt city 
the place of determining fate 
Man and city Life and wellbeing 
proclaim for him Let praise ring out 
Let him be made surpassing above all to his right or left 
Tireless lamma deity take hold of his head 
pronounce his fate in charitable words

The roaring storm covered it like a cloak was spread over it like a sheet 
It covered Eridu like a cloak was spread over it like a sheet 
In Eridu the furious storm resounded 
Its voice was smothered with silence as by a gale Its people  
Its king stayed outside his city as if it were an alien city He wept bitter tears 
Father Enki stayed outside his city as if it were an alien city He wept bitter tears 
For the sake of his harmed city he wept bitter tears 
Its lady like a flying bird left her city 
The mother of Ema holy Damgalnuna left her city 
The divine powers of the city of holiest divine powers were overturned 
The divine powers of the rites of the greatest divine powers were altered 
In Eridu everything was reduced to ruin was wrought with confusion 
The evilbearing storm went out from the city It swept across the Land 
a storm which possessses neither kindness nor malice does not distinguish between good and evil 
Subir came down like rain It struck hard 
In the city where bright daylight used to shine forth the day darkened 
In Eridu where bright daylight used to shine forth the day darkened

A tigi of Baba 
 entire land  
 struck the palace was devastated 
 abandoned places  in Sumer 
 the cities were destroyed in their entirety the people were seized with panic 
Evil came upon Ur and made the trustworthy shepherd pass away 
It made UrNamma the trustworthy shepherd pass away it made the trustworthy shepherd pass away 
Because An had altered his holy words completely  became empty 
and because deceitfully Enlil had completely changed the fate he decreed 
Enki shut  the great door of Eridug 
Nudimmud withdrew into his bedchamber and lay down fasting 
At his zenith Nanna frowned at the  words of An 
Utu did not come forth in the sky and the day was full of sorrow 
The mother miserable because of her son 
the mother of the king holy Ninsumun was crying Oh my heart 
Because of the fate decreed for UrNamma 
because it made the trustworthy shepherd pass away 
she was weeping bitterly in the broad square which is otherwise a place of entertainment 
Sweet sleep did not come to the people whose happiness  
they passed their time in lamentation over the trustworthy shepherd who had been snatched away 
As the early flood was filling the canals their canalinspector was already silenced  
the mottled barley grown on the arable lands the life of the land was inundated 
To the farmer the fertile fields planted  by him yielded little 
Enkimdu the lord of levees and ditches took away the levees and ditches from Ur 
As the intelligence and  of the Land were lost fine food became scarce 
As the intelligence and  of the Land were lost fine food became scarce 
The plains did not grow lush grass any more they grew the grass of mourning 
he cows  their  cattlepen has been destroyed 
The calves  their cows bleated bitterly 
The wise shepherd  does not give orders any more 
 in battle and combat 
The king the advocate of Sumer the ornament of the assembly 
UrNamma the advocate of Sumer the ornament of the assembly 
His hands which used to grasp cannot grasp any more he lies sick 
His feet  cannot step any more he lies sick 
The trustworthy shepherd king the sword of Sumer 
The trustworthy shepherd king the sword of Sumer 
UrNamma the king of the Land was taken to the  house 
He was taken to Ur the king of the Land was brought into the  house 
UrNamma he who was beloved by the troops could not raise his neck any more 
The wise one  lay down silence descended 
As he who was the vigour of the Land had fallen the Land became demolished like a mountain 
As if he were a boxwood tree they put axes against him in his joyous dwelling place 
As if he were a sappy cedar tree he was uprooted in the palace where he used to sleep  
His spouse  resting place 
 was covered by a storm it embraced it like a wife her sweetheart  
His appointed time had arrived and he passed away in his prime 
His  pleasing sacrifices were no longer accepted they were treated as dirty  
The Anuna gods refused his gifts 
An did not stand by an It is enough and he could not complete his  days 
Because of what Enlil ordered there was no more rising up 
his beloved men lost their wise one 
Strangers turned into   
His  with grandeur like  thick clouds  
He does not  any more and he does not reach out for  
 UrNamma alas what is it to me 
To Arali the preeminent place of the Land 
UrNamma the son of Ninsumun was brought in his prime 
The soldiers accompanying the king shed tears 
their boat ie UrNamma was sunk in a land as foreign to them as Dilmun 
 was cut 
 its bolt was broken off 
 was put aside it stood  in saltpetre 
His donkeys were to be found with the king they were buried with him 
His donkeys were to be found with UrNamma they were buried with him 
As he crossed over the  of the Land the Land was deprived of its ornament 
Because of the king the chariots were covered over the roads were thrown into disorder no one could go up and down on them 
ecause of UrNamma the chariots were covered over the roads were thrown into disorder no one could go up and down on them 
He presented gifts to the seven chief porters of the nether world 
As the famous kings who had died 
and the dead iib priests luma priests and nindigir priestesses all chosen by extispicy 
announced the kings coming to the people a tumult arose in the nether world 
The king slaughtered numerous bulls and sheep 
UrNamma seated the people at a huge banquet 
The food of the nether world is bitter the water of the nether world is brackish 
UrNamma presented the offerings of the nether world 
A mace a large bow with quiver and arrows an artfully made barbed dagger 
and a multicoloured leather bag for wearing at the hip 
to Nergal the Enlil of the nether world 
in his palace the shepherd UrNamma offered to him 
A spear a leather bag for a saddlehook a heavenly lionheaded imitum mace 
a shield resting on the ground a heroic weapon 
to Gilgame the king of the nether world 
in his palace the shepherd UrNamma offered to him 
A  which he filled with oil a agan bowl of perfect make 
 the divine powers of the nether world

in her palace the shepherd UrNamma offered to her 
a lordly golden sceptre  a shining hand 
to Dumuzid the beloved husband of inanna 
in his palace the shepherd UrNamma offered to him 
1 ms adds He  a gold and silver  
a lapislazuli  and a  pin 
to Dimpikug  
perfectly wrought jewellery a golden ring cast  as a  barge 
pure cornelian stone fit to be worn on the breasts of the gods 
in his palace the shepherd UrNamma offered to him 
a chest  with a lapislazuli handle containing  everything that is essential in the underworld 
a silver hair clasp adorned with lapislazuli and a comb of womanly fashion 
to ubisag the wife of Namtar 
in her palace the shepherd UrNamma offered to her 
a chariot with  wheels sparkling with gold 
 donkeys thoroughbreds 
followed  by a shepherd and a herdsman 
to the valiant warrior Ningizida 
in his palace the shepherd UrNamma offered to him 
A lapislazuli seal hanging from a pin 
and a gold and silver togglepin with a bisons head 
He gave to Dimpimekug who stands by his side 
a  stylus the hallmark of the scribe 
a surveyors gleaming rope and the 1 ninda rod  
o his spouse Ninazimua 
the august scribe denizen of Arali 
in her palace the shepherd UrNamma offered to her 
the great  of the nether world he gave 
the great  of the nether world he gave 
after the king had presented properly the offerings of the nether world 
after UrNamma had presented properly the offerings of the nether world 
the  of the underworld 
the  
and set up a dwelling place for him in the nether world 
At the command of Erekigala 
all the soldiers who had been killed by weapons 
and all the men who had been found guilty 
were given into the kings hands 
so with Gilgame his beloved brother 
he will issue the judgments of the nether world and render the decisions of the nether world 
After seven days 1 days had passed 
lamenting for Sumer overwhelmed UrNamma 
That he could not complete the wall of Ur 
that he could no longer enjoy the new palace he had built 
that he the shepherd could no longer  his household  
that he could no longer bring pleasure to his wife with his embrace 
that he could not bring up his sons on his knees 
that he would never see in their prime the beauty of their little sisters who had not yet grown up  
 my kings heart was full of tears he  bitterly 
The trustworthy shepherd  a heartrending lament for himself 
served the gods well set up chapels for them 
I have created evident abundance for the Anuna gods 
I have laid treasures on their beds strewn with fresh herbs 
Yet no god stood by me and soothed my heart 
Because of them anything that could have been a favourable portent for me was as far away from me as the heavens 
the  What is my reward for my eagerness to serve during the days 
Now just as the rain pouring down from heaven cannot turn back 
alas nor can I turn back to brickbuilt Ur 
She spends the days in tears and bitter laments 
My strength has ebbed away  
The hand of the fate demon  bitterly me the hero 
Like a cow  
Like a wild bull  
Like an offshoot  
Like an ass  I died 
 my  wife  
She spends the days in tears and bitter laments 
her kind protective goddess does not care for her any more 
Ninsumun no longer rests her august arm firmly on her head 
Nanna Lord Aimbabbar no longer leads  her by the hand 
Enki the lord of Eridug does not  
Her  has been silenced  she can no longer answer 
Like a wild ass lured  into a perilous pit she has been treated heavyhandedly 
Like a lion fallen into a pitfall a guard has been set up for her 
Like a dog kept in a cage she is silenced 
Utu  does not pay heed to the cries Oh my king overwhelming her 
My tigi adab flute and zamzam songs have been turned into laments because of me 
The instruments of the house of cantorship have been propped against the wall 
Instead of my throne whose beauty was endless 
I have been made to  in a soilfilled pit 
My wife and my children are in tears and wailing 
My people whom I used to command  sing like lamentation 
and dirge singers because of her  
Enlil had sent her as a messenger to all the foreign lands concerning very important matters 
When she had turned her gaze away from there 
inanna humbly entered the shining Ekur 
she  at Enlils fierce brow 
Then Enlil said Great lady of the Eana once someone has bowed down he cannot   any more 
the trustworthy shepherd left Eana you cannot see him any more 
My lady  among the people  
hen inanna the fierce storm the eldest child of Suen  
made the heavens tremble made the earth shake 
inanna destroyed cattlepens devastated sheepfolds saying 
I want to hurl insults at An the king of the gods 
Who can change the matter if Enlil elevates someone 
Who can change the import of the august words uttered by An the king 
If there are divine ordinances imposed on the Land but they are not observed 
there will be no abundance at the godss place of sunrise 
My holy gipar the shrine Eana has been barred up like  a mountain 
If only my shepherd could enter before me in it in his prime  I will not enter it otherwise 
If only my strong one could grow for me like greenery in the desert 
If only he could hold steady for me like a river boat at its calm mooring 
This is how inanna gave vent  to a lament over him 
Lord Ningizida  
UrNamma my  who was killed 
Among tears and laments  
Among tears and laments  
 decreed a fate for UrNamma 
UrNamma  your august name will be called upon 
From the south to the uplands  the holy sceptre 
Sumer  to your palace 
the large and grand arable tracts which you have  
the reedbeds which you have drained 
and the fortresses and settlements which you have  
The people will admire them  
UrNamma they will call upon  your name 
Lord Nunamnir surpassing  
will drive away the evil spirits  
Nanna Lord Aimbabbar  
Enki the king of Eridug  
 holy  lion born on high 
 basket   
 your city renders just judgments  
 Lord Ningizida be praised 
 frowned at  
 the day was full of sorrow 
 withdrew into his bedchamber and lay down fasting 
The mother wretched  because of her son  
That the fate of UrNamma had been overturned 
and that the trustworthy shepherd had been made to pass away 
she was weeping bitterly in the broad square which is otherwise a place of entertainment 
She spent the day in lamentation over the trustworthy shepherd who had been snatched away 
Sweet sleep did not  come to the people whose happiness had come to an end 
As the early flood was filling the canals their canalinspector  
Enkimdu the lord of levees and ditches  
 its numerous people  
 of the Land  
The plains  fine grass  
UrNamma  
His hands which used to grasp cannot  
His feet which used to tread  
The trustworthy shepherd the king the  of Sumer UrNamma  
As he himself was going to Ur UrNamma  house 
The proud one lying in the palace UrNamma who  by the troops   
He could not rise any more the wise one of the countries lay down silence  
As he who was the vigour of the Land has fallen the land became demolished like a mountain 
As he a cypress forest was felled the state of the Land became confused 
As he the cedar tree of the Land was uprooted the state of the Land became altered 
His appointed time arrived and he passed away in his prime 
His  pleasing sacrifices were no longer accepted they were treated as dirty  
The Anuna gods did not reach out for his gifts any more 
 did not stand by an It is enough his  days were not prolonged 
there was no more rising up 
UrNamma a broken jar was abandoned at  
 what is it to me 
 what is it to me

and a multicoloured leather bag for wearing at the hip 
to Nergal the Enlil of the nether world 
in his palace the shepherd UrNamma offered to him 
A spear a leather bag for  the saddlehook  a heavenly lionheaded mitum mace 
a shield resting on the ground and a battleaxe an implement beloved of Erekigala 
to Gilgame the king of the nether world

A chest with a lapislazuli handle containing  everything that is essential in the underworld

to Dimpimekug who stands at the right and the left  
the shepherd UrNamma  and offered her in her  palace 
The magnificent bulls faultless kids and fattened sheep that he had 
to  the great ensi of the nether world 
in his palace the shepherd UrNamma offered them 
The great  of the underworld 
the Anuna after the offerings were presented 
they  seated UrNamma on a great dais of the nether world 
and set up a dwelling place for him in the nether world 
At the command of Erekigala 
concerning  all the men who fell by weapons 
and all the men who  guilty 
with  Gilgame his beloved brother 
he will pass the judgments of the nether world and render the decisions 
lamenting for Sumer overwhelmed UrNamma 
As he could not complete the wall of Ur 
as he the shepherd could no longer protect  his household 
as he could no longer bring pleasure to his wife with his embrace 
as he could not bring up his sons on his knees 
as he would never see in their prime the beauty of their little sisters who are yet to grow up 
the trustworthy shepherd uttered a heartrending lament for himself 
 for the great gods I have set up chapels for them 
I have created evident abundance for the Anuna gods 
I have  treasures to their  shining thrones 
 a favourable portent for me was  as the nether world or the heavens  
 guard  
 guard  
 silence  
 adab flute and zamzam songs  laments 
 have been propped against the wall 
Because I have been made to sit on

Because I have been made to fall in  
Maiden inanna the warlike lady  
Enlil had sent her as a messenger to all the great mountains 
When she had turned her gaze away from there

They were drinking water in the ditches 
In their temple on the Holy Mound  was creating lahar and Ezina 
They gathered them into the shrine where the gods ate food 
The abundance of lahar and Anan 
Were eating but none among them were able to be filled 
The milkcream of their holy sheepfold the sweet thing the Anuna gods of the Holy Mound were drinking but none among them were able to be filled 
Humanity  
At that time Enki spoke to Enlil 
Father Enlil both lahar and Ezina 
Becauseafter created them on the Holy Mound 
We shall send them down from the Holy Mound 
This is how both Enki and Enlil spoke in their holy conversation 
They were sending down both lahar and Ezina from the Holy Mound 
They were giving vast vegetation to her 
For Ezina they were putting down a fertile field 
They were giving to her the plow the yoke and its plow team 
After lahar stood in the sheepfold 
After the shepherd furnished her with allure in the sheepfold 
After Ezina stood in the furrow 
She was a beautifulverdant young woman bearing allure 
After she raised her fertile head in the field 
After she was poured upon by the abundance of heaven 
Both lahar and Ezina appeared 
In heaven abundance was there for them 
In the land life force was there for them 
They were properly executing the me of the gods 
They were making things proliferate in the storehouse of the land 
Into the prison founded in the dust 
After they entered abundance was there for them 
The two of them lit their two where they set their feet 
They are the ones who increase things in the house heavily 
Where they stand they are correct where they sit they are appropriate 
They are ones that are pleasant in the heart of An and the heart of Enlil 
The were drinking sweetintoxicating wine 
They were making themselves sweet ie getting drunk with sweetintoxicating beer 
After they drank sweetintoxicating wine

LipitItar you are the appeal of her heart 
When I was going when I was going 
When I the almighty lady of all mankind 
 I am the lady  was going to the Abzu 
When I  I am the lady of heaven  was going to the Abzu 
When I was going to the Abzu the princely house 
When I was going to sweet Eridu 
When I was going to the HouseoftheSweetWaters 
When I was going to the HouseofHeaven the house of Enlil 
When I was going to where the firstfruit offerings are brought in daily 
When I was going to where large bowls have been placed outdoors 
When I was going to where jars have been offered by a pure hand 
When I was going to where the righteous man raised his hand 
When I was going to where the lord Enki raised his hand 
When I was going to where Damgalnuna raised her hand 
then I brought a dog along with me I brought a lion along with me 
I brought boxwood along with me I brought halubwood along with me 
I am the LadyofHeaven I accepted the breezes 
When I  I am the lady  was strolling about the marshes 
I am indeed the arabubird of the marshes 
When I was going at the opening of the battle 
I am forthcoming daydaydaylight 
When I am going in front of the battle 
When I was following the battle 
I am devastation that rose up wickedly 
I am a woman who is surpassing the mountain 
Against the mountain ranges I speak angry words 
My husband took his place in front of me 
Against Utu and Nanna they take part in combat 
Against Sud the one with the water of the holy dish they take part in combat 
On the river on the river like sailing on the river  like the spouse sweet like the town sweet such a sweet thing does not exist  
On the river on the Princecanal like sailing on the river 
On the course of the Euphrates like sailing on the river 
Like the deity of mankind went with her 
Like the spouse sweet like the town sweet such a sweet thing does not exist 
Like Enki the wild bull of the sweet town went with her 
Like Enlil ate and like he drank  like the spouse sweet like the town sweet such a sweet thing does not exist 
 my heart is placed 
To the house where the righteous man raised his hand 
To that house where the righteous man raised his hand 
In the Eag that man set up a bed in flowers 
In the HouseofHeaven the linenclad erected a stone for him 
Addressing the lord water was prepared 
They are telling him to refresh in the palace 
O Dumuzi it is in the house a place bright as a day it is 
Mother Inanna InannaofHeaven your clothes your clothes 
Your black clothes your white clothes 
It is indeed my man who strolled around the house 
It is indeed a song a hearts lament 
Its me it is indeed They shall place the me 
Its place it is indeed They shall set the proper place 
They shall place him they shall place him 
They shall place Enlil in the kiur 
O lord life of the land I will revive that man 
For its men I will make a firm promise in the cella 
Whatever it is that you say as firm promise in the rear part of the palace 
O Inanna your breast is indeed your field 
O Inanna your breast is indeed your field 
When you poured out barley in the wide field 
Then draw water from there and establish it for the men 
Draw much water from there and establish it plentifully for the men 
After you have told it the man addressed 
I will drink that on your behalf 
It is an incantationsong of Inanna 
76 are its lines 
The supporting beam crumbling like breads crumbs destroyed him with water 
Did you see the man who had fallen from the roof How is he found there 
He  like an ox eaten by parasites 
Did you see the man who was overtaken by the curse of his mother and father How is he found there 
His heir has absconded from him his ghost roams around 
His food is set aside his water is set aside 
He is eating  food he is drinking  water 
He is eating  food he is drinking  water 
Did you see the man who fell in battle How is he found there 
There his father and mother do not grasp his head his wife weeps 
Did you see the man whose corpse lies in the plain  How is he found there 
Did you see the man whose corpse lies in the plain  How is he found there 
 apart from  
Did you see the ghost that does not have someone to provide funerary offerings for him I saw him How is he treated 
Did you see the ghost that does not have someone to provide funerary offerings for him I saw him How is he treated 
 he eats his bread crumbs that have fallen into the street 
Did you see the tiny stillborn babies who do not know their own names How are they found there 
They play in a troughbucket of gold and silver filled with honey and ghee 
In those days in those distant days 
in those years in those distant years 
in days of yore when the necessary things had been brought into manifest existence 
when bread had been tasted for the first time in the shrines of the Land 
when the ovens of the Land had been made to work 
when the heavens had been separated from the earth 
when the earth had been delimited from the heavens 
when An had taken the heavens for himself 
when Enlil had taken the earth for himself 
when the nether world had been given to Erekigal as a gift 
when he set sail when he set sail 
when the father set sail for the nether world 
against the king a storm of small hailstones arose 
against Enki a storm of large hailstones arose 
the large ones were like stones from catapults  
The keel of Enkis little boat 
as if it were being butted by turtles was trembling 
against the king the waves at the bow of the boat 
like a lion were attacking 
At that time there was a single tree a single alub tree a single tree 
growing on the bank of the pure Euphrates 
being watered by the Euphrates 
The force of the south wind uprooted it and stripped its branches 
and the Euphrates picked it up and carried it away 
respectful of Enlils words was walking along 
and took the tree and into Unug 
into Inannas luxuriant garden brought it 
The woman planted the tree not with her hands but with her feet 
The woman planted the tree not with her hands but with her feet planted it 
When this will be a luxuriant bed on which I can lie down she said 
5 years 1 years went by 
At its roots a snake immune to incantations made itself a nest 
In its branches the Anzud bird settled its young 
In its trunk the phantom maid built herself a dwelling 
But silver Inanna cried 
When dawn was breaking when the horizon became bright 
when the little birds at the break of dawn began to clamor 
when Utu had left his bedchamber 
his sister silver Inanna 
to the young warrior Utu said 
My brother in those days when destiny was determined 
when abundance overflowed in the Land 
when the nether world had been given to Erekigala as a gift 
when he set sail when he set sail 
when the father set sail for the nether world 
when Enki set sail for the nether world 
against the lord a storm of small hailstones arose 
against Enki a storm of large hailstones arose 
The small ones were light hammers 
The keel of Enkis little boat was trembling 
as if it were being butted by turtles 
against the lord the waves at the bow of the boat 
against Enki the waves at the stern of the boat were attacking Enki like a lion 
like a lion were attacking 
At that time there was a single tree a single alub tree a single tree  
growing on the bank of the pure Euphrates 
The force of the south wind uprooted it and stripped its branches 
and the Euphrates picked it up and carried it away 
I a woman respectful of Ans words was walking along 
respectful of Enlils words was walking along 
and took the tree and brought it into Unug 
into silver Inannas luxuriant garden 
I the woman planted the tree not with my hands but with my feet 
When will this be a luxuriant chair on which I can take a seat 
When will this be a luxuriant bed on which I can lie down she said 
5 years 1 years had gone by 
the tree had grown massive its bark however did not split 
In its branches the Anzu bird settled its young 
In its trunk the phantom maid built herself a dwelling 
the maid who laughs with a joyful heart 
But silver Inanna cried 
Her brother the young warrior Utu however did not stand by her in the matter 
When dawn was breaking when the horizon became bright 
when the little birds at the break of dawn began to clamor 
when Utu had left his bedchamber 
his sister silver Inanna 
to the warrior Gilgame speaks 
My brother in those days when destiny was determined 
when abundance overflowed in the Land 
when An had taken the heavens for himself 
when Enlil had taken the earth for himself 
when the nether world had been given to Erekigala as a gift 
when he set sail when he set sail 
when the father set sail for the nether world 
The small ones were light hammers 
the large ones were like stones from catapults  
as if it were being butted by turtles was trembling 
against the lord the waves at the bow of the boat 
like wolves rose to devour 
against Enki the waves at the stern of the boat 
like a lion were attacking 
At that time there was a single tree a single alub tree a single tree  
growing on the bank of the pure Euphrates 
The force of the south wind uprooted it and stripped its branches 
I a woman respectful of Ans words was walking along 
respectful of Enlils words was walking along 
and took the tree and brought it into Unug 
into Inannas luxuriant garden 
The woman planted the tree not with her hands but with her feet 
Inanna watered it using not her hands but her feet 
When will this be a luxuriant chair on which I can take a seat she said 
When will this be a luxuriant bed on which I can lie down she said 
5 years 1 years had gone by 
At its roots a snake immune to incantations made itself a nest 
In its branches the Anzu bird settled its young 
In its trunk the phantom maid built herself a dwelling 
I silver Inanna cried 
In the matter which his sister had told him about 
His bronze axe used for expeditions 
which weighs 7 talents and 7 minas in his hand he took 
He killed the snake immune to incantations living at its roots 
The Anzu bird living in its branches took up its young and went into the mountains 
The phantom maid living in its trunk left  her dwelling 
As for the tree he uprooted it and stripped its branches 
and the sons of his city who went with him 
cut up its branches and bundled them 
He gave it to his sister silver Inanna for her chair 
He gave it to her for her bed 
As for himself from its roots he manufactured his ball  
and from its branches he manufactured his mallet  
and he praised himself in the broad square never wanting to stop praising himself 
The young men of his city were playing with the ball  
For  him who made the team of the widows children  
they lamented O my neck O my hips 
For those that had a mother bread for her son she brought 
he marked the spot where the ball  had been placed 
and he picked up his ball  from in front of him and took it home 
But early in the morning as he  the place marked 
and the young girls complaint 
caused his ball  and his mallet  to fall down to the bottom of the nether world 
He could not reach them by  
tried with his foot but could not reach them 
At the gate of Ganzer in front of the nether world he sat down 
Gilgamesh wept crying bitterly 
My ball  I am still not satiated with its charms 
the game with it has not yet palled for me 
I would treat the carpenters wife like my own mother 
My ball  has fallen down to the nether worldwho will retrieve it for me 
My mallet  has fallen down to Ganzerwho will retrieve it for me 
His servant Enkidu answered 
My king you weep why does your heart worry 
Today I shall retrieve your ball  from the nether world 
I shall retrieve your mallet  from Ganzer 
Gilgamesh answered Enkidu 
If today you are going to go down to the nether world 
let me advise you My instructions should be followed 
Let me talk to you Pay attention to my words 
You should not put on your clean garments 
they would recognise immediately that you are alien 
You should not anoint yourself with fine oil from a bowl 
they would surround you at its scent 
You should not hurl throwsticks in the nether world 
those struck down by the throwsticks would surround you 
You should not not hold a cornelwood stick in your hand 
You should not put sandals on your feet 
You should not shout in the nether world 
You should not kiss your beloved wife 
You should not kiss your beloved child 
You should not hit your son even if you are annoyed with him 
Ninazus mother who lies there 
her pure shoulders are not covered with a garment 
and no linen is spread over her pure breast 
she plucks her hair out like leeks 
He put on his clean garments 
and they recognised that he was alien 
and they surrounded him at its scent 
He hurled throwsticks in the nether world 
He held a cornelwood stick in his hand 
and the spirits felt insulted by him 
He put sandals on his feet 
He caused irritation in the nether world 
and hit his wife when he was annoyed with her 
He kissed his beloved child 
and hit his son when he was annoyed with him 
He aroused an outcry and was detained in the nether world 
The warrior Gilgamesh son of Ninsumun 
directed his steps on his own to Ekur the temple of Enlil 
He cried before Enlil 
Father Enlil my ball  fell down into the nether world my mallet  fell down into Ganzer 
Enkidu went down to retrieve them but the nether world has seized him 
The udug demon of Nergal who spares nobody did not seize him but the nether world has seized him 
He did not fall in battle on the field of manhood but the nether world has seized him 
In Eridu he directed his steps on his own to the temple of Enki 
Enkidu went down to retrieve them but the nether world has seized him 
The udug demon of Nergal who spares nobody did not seize him but the nether world has seized him 
Father Enki stood by him in this matter 
He said to the young warrior Utu the son born by Ningal 
Open a window in the nether world immediately 
and then bring up his servant from the nether world 
He opened a window in the nether world 
and brought up his servant with his breeze  from the nether world 
They wearied each other with questions 
Did you see the order of the nether world 
If only you would tell me my friend if only you would tell me 
If I tell you the order of the nether world 
si yourself down and weep I shall sit down and weep 
 which your heart rejoiced to touch 
like  of  a crevice it is full of dust 
Alas he said and sat down in the dust 
Did you see him who had 1 son I saw him How does he fare 
He weeps bitterly at the wooden peg which was driven into his wall 
Did you see him who had 2 sons I saw him How does he fare 
He sits on 2 bricks eating bread 
He drinks water from a saddle waterskin 
Did you see him who had 4 sons I saw him How does he fare 
His heart rejoices like a man who has four asses to yoke 
Like a good scribe he is indefatigable he enters the palace easily 
Did you see him who had 6 sons I saw him How does he fare 
He is a cheerful as a ploughman 
Did you see him who had 7 sons I saw him How does he fare 
As a companion of the gods he sits on a throne and listens to judgments 
Did you see the palace eunuch I saw him How does he fare 
Did you see the woman who never gave birth I saw her How does she fare 
Like a  pot she is thrown away violently she gives no man joy 
Did you see the young man who never undressed his wife I saw him How does he fare 
You finish a rope and he weeps over the rope 
Did you see the young woman who never undressed her husband I saw her How does she fare 
You finish a reed mat and she weeps over the reed mat 
Did you see him who had no heir I saw him How does he fare 
Like him who  bricks  he eats bread 
Did you see  
Did you see  
Did you see him who was eaten by a lion 
He cries bitterly O my hands O my legs 
Did you see him who fell down from the roof 
They cannot  his bones 
Did you see the leprous man 
Did you see him who fell in battle I saw him How does he fare 
His father and mother are not there to hold his head and his wife weeps 
Did you see the spirit of him who has no funerary offerings I saw him How does he fare 
He eats the scraps and the crumbs  tossed out in the street 
Did you see him hit by a ships board How does he fare 
as he pulls out the ships board  
Did you see my little stillborn children who never knew existence I saw them How do they fare 
They play at a table of gold and silver laden with honey and ghee 
Did you see him who died  I saw him How does he fare 
He lies on a bed of the gods 
Did you see him who was set on fire I did not see him

The governors sagga officials 
And the land recorders of the border of the plain 
At the gate of Agade exhaustion was placed 
Holy Inanna did not know how to accept the nindaba offering anymore 
Aslike a citizen the temple to be founded did not satisfy her 
The matterword of the Ekur engendered dazed silence 
Trembling lingered for Inanna in Agade 
In Ulma Inanna was afraid 
She went out from the city into her original place of dwelling 
Holy Inanna abandoned the shrine of Agade 
Like a warrior advancing against the weapon 
She imposed battle and combat apart from the city 
She beat the breast for the enemy instead 
The bindings of the enship the crown of kingship 
He bound his hands towards the Ekur temple 
He acted towards the giguna like it was worth a mere thirty gig 
He acted towards the giguna like it was worth a mere thirty gig 
Like a male thief who plunders a city 
He gathered upimposed great ladders for use against the temple 
In order to destroy the Ekur temple like a great boat 
As if to cutseparate it like the mountain range of lapis lazuli 
Although the temple was not inof the mountain of the cut juniper 
He brought great hazin axes towards it 
month Harvest 
year The ShuSuen king of Ur the boat named IbexofAbzu caulked 
The gakkul vat the gakkul vat 
The gakkul vat the lamsare vat  
The gakkul vat that puts us in a happy mood 
The ugurbala jar glory of the house 
The amam jar that carries the beer from the lamsare vat 
All the beautiful vessels are ready on their pot stands  
May the stomach of your god be well disposed towards you 
Let the eye of the gakkul vat be our eye  
and let the stomach of the gakkul vat be our heart 
What makes your stomach feel wonderful in itself  
also makes our stomachs feel wonderful in themselves 
We are in a happy mood our stomachs are joyful 
You have poured a libation over the brick of fate 
and you have laid the foundations in peace and prosperity 
now may Ninkasi dwell with you  
She should transfer one to the other beer and wine for you  
Let the pouring of the sweet liquor resound pleasantly for you 
In the troughs of bur grass there is sweet beer  
I will have the cupbearers the boys and the brewers stand by 
As I spin around the lake of drinks 
while drinking beer in a blissful mood 
while drinking alcohol and feeling exhilarated 
with joy in the stomach and a contented liver 
my stomach is a heart stomach with joy 
I clothe my contented liver in a garment fit for a queen 
The stomach of Inanna is happy once again 
the stomach of Inanna is happy once again

By word of the assembly 
the herald in the streets sounded the trumpet 
No one may hold him liable for anything 
LuSuen the general 
Zuzu the headmaster 
Sidu the scribe 
Adlub the steward 
Bansage the lamentationpriest and temple administrator 
Mullia the mayor 
and the herald are the witnesses 
After you speak to my king 
To my ram of the mountain range with beautiful horns 
Horse of the mountain range with claws of an eagle 
Date palm grown in a pure place from which shining dates hang down 
For Abaindasa the overseer of the arrayed troops 
he who by delighting his king pleases the heart of his king 
Your servant thus says 
When the boat is idle I prepare the oars 
When the water is standing still I can make it flow 
When the wind is still I prepare the grain 
When  I illuminate  
When the water is still I make it flow 
As a scribe I incise a stele 
the words of the army I   
I am able to reproduce the dropped and excised words of the assembly 
the sweet words copies   
But now as if I was planted like a tree in my forest I bend over as one who is dirty 
The one who is near to the royal throne has bound my hands with rope 
In my city I the one who wore a clean garment now wears a dirty garment 
As one who has washed with mud clods I caked dirt to serve as facial makeup 
An uumgal creature that kills has also left behind scraps 
After the reedbed is consumed by fire the ponds remain 
After Utu has consumed ghee has consumed cheese he touches the churn to make it more productive 
I have brought out my lifebreath take hold of my hand 
I am the child of a widow one who has not had anyone to inquire after him 
as for me when will the heart of ulgi my king be returned to its place on my behalf 
To my lord the bull with sparkling eyes a beard of lapislazuli sporting 
speak 
To my golden statue on a favorable day born
to my water buffalo in a holy fold reared in the silverstomach of Inanna chosen
You are fashioned like the son of An 
your utterances like the words of a god are irrevocable
your utterances like rain pouring from the skies are uncountable 
this is what Ursaga your servant says 
My lord has taken care of me I am a son of Ur 
If my lord agrees
my fathers household let no one carry off 
Messenger messenger to my mother 
say 
what monkey says 
Ur is the city resplendent of Nanna 
 In Eridu the city abundant of Enki 
 indeed I behind the door of the house of the Chief Musician am sitting 
Looks are feeding me 
May I not die 
There being no fresh bread there being no fresh beer 
have a courier send some to me 
Its a flood 
At his command your weapon struck me evilly 
At his command your weapon struck me evilly 
At his command your weapon struck me evilly 
At his command your weapon struck me evilly 
At his command your weapon struck me evilly 
At his command your weapon struck me evilly 
As I let the divine powers go out of my hand these divine powers returned to the abzu 
Ninurta was stunned at these words of the Anzuchick 
Ninmena gave out a wail 
And what about me These divine powers have not fallen into my hand 
I shall not exercise their authority I shall not live  like him in the shrine in the abzu 
Father Enki in the abzu knew what had been said 
and drew near with him to Enkis place the abzu 
The Anzuchick returned Utaulu to the abzu 
The lord was delighted with the hero 
Father Enki was delighted with the hero Ninurta 
Lord Nudimmud honored him duly 
Hero no god among your brother gods could have acted so 
As for the bird which your mighty weapon captured 
from now to eternity you will keep your foot placed on its neck 
May the great gods give your heroic strength its due 
May your father Enlil do whatever you command 
May no one be as revered as you and no god extend an upraised hand before you 
Monthly may your house  regularly receive tributes in the shrine in the abzu 
The hero secretly was not happy with these promises 
The hero Ninurta set his sights on the whole world 
In the shrine in the abzu he stirred up a dark floodstorm 
By the house the minister Isimud opposed Ninurta 
The hero Ninurta refused to come out 
and raised his hand against the minister Isimud 
Against Ninurta Enki fashioned a turtle from the clay of the abzu 
Enki talked to him near the place of the ambush 
and brought him to the place where the turtle was 
The turtle was able to grab Ninurtas tendon from behind 
The hero Ninurta managed to turn back its feet 
Enki as if perplexed said What is this 
He had the turtle scrape the ground with its claws had it dig an evil pit 
The hero Ninurta fell into it with the turtle 
The turtle kept on gnawing his feet with its claws  
The great lord Enki said to him 
From  you who set your mind to kill me 
 who makes big claims 
You who set your sights on me like this 
what has your position seized for you how  
In the great mountains you caused destruction but how will you get out now 
Ninmena learned of this situation 
She was ripping the clothes from her body she   
My ugplanteater Enki whom shall I send to you 
Men will shake their heads in fear  whom shall I send to you 
That name is not Enki That name is Uguguthatdoesnotpour  
You who are death without mercy whom shall I send to you 
In those remote days when the fates were determined 
in a year when An brought about abundance 
and people broke through the earth like green plants  
built up his temple entirely from silver and lapis lazuli 
was erected for Lord Nudimmud 
He built the temple from precious metal decorated it with lapis lazuli 
and covered it abundantly with gold 
In Eridu he built the house on the bank 
Its brickwork makes utterances and gives advice 
Its eaves roar like a bull 
the temple of Enki bellows 
During the night the temple praises its lord and offers its best for him 
Before Lord Enki Isimud the minister praises the temple 
he goes to the temple and speaks to it 
He goes to the brick building and addresses it 
Temple built from precious metal and lapis lazuli 
whose foundation pegs are driven into the abzu 
which has been cared for by the prince in the abzu 
Like the Tigris and the Euphrates it is mighty and aweinspiring  
Joy has been brought into Enkis abzu 
Your lock has no rival 
Your bolt is a fearsome lion 
Your roof beams are the bull of heaven an artfully made bright headgear 
Your reedmats are like lapis lazuli decorating the roofbeams 
Your vault is a wild bull raising its horns 
Your door is a lion who seizes a man 
Abzu pure place which fulfils its purpose 
Eengura Your lord has directed his steps towards you 
Enki lord of the abzu 
has embellished your foundation pegs with cornelian 
He has adorned you with  and  lapis lazuli 
The temple of Enki is provisioned with silver wax  
roaring by itself and giving advice at the same time 
Eengura which Enki has surrounded with a silver reed fence 
your doorjamb is the silver locking bar of heaven 
Abzu pure place place where the fates are determined 
Enki the lord deciding fates 
Nudimmud the lord of Eridu 
lets nobody look into its midst 
Your abgal priests let their hair down their backs 
Enkis beloved Eridu 
Eengura whose inside is full of abundance 
Abzu life of the Land beloved of Enki 
Temple built on the edge befitting the artful divine powers 
Eridu your shadow extends over the midst of the sea 
Eridu your shadow extends over the midst of the sea Rising sea without a rival 
mighty aweinspiring river which terrifies the Land 
Temple at the edge of the engur a lion in the midst of the abzu 
lofty temple of Enki which bestows wisdom on the Land 
To his silver house its goodness he sets 
the lyre the algar instrument the balag drum 
The  with a sweet sound 
resounded by themselves 
The silver algar instrument of Enki played for him on his own 
and seven tigi drums resounded 
What Enki says is irrefutable 
This is what Isimud spoke to the brick building 
As it has been built as it has been built 
it is an artfully built mountain which floats on the water 
In its green orchards laden with fruit 
birds brood 
The suhur carp play among the honeyherbs 
and the esztub carp dart among the small gizi reeds 
When Enki rises the fish rise before him like waves 
He has the abzu stand as a marvel 
as he brings joy into the engur 
Like the sea he is aweinspiring 
like a mighty river he instils fear 
His punting pole is Nirah 
his oars are the small reeds 
As he leaves the temple of Eridu 
the river gurgles  to its lord 
its sound is a calfs mooing the mooing of a good cow 
Enki had oxen slaughtered and had sheep offered there lavishly 
Where there were no ala drums he installed some in their places 
where there were no bronze ub drums he despatched some to their places 
He directed his steps on his own to Nibru 
and entered the temple terrace the shrine of Nibru 
Enki reached for  the beer he reached for  the liquor 
He had liquor poured into big bronze containers 
and had emmerwheat beer pressed out  
He  its branmash 
In the shrine of Nibru Enki 
provided a meal for Enlil his father 
He seated An at the head of the table 
and seated Enlil next to An 
He seated Nintur in the place of honour 
and seated the Anuna gods at the adjacent places  
All of them were drinking and enjoying beer and liquor 
and started a competition drinking from the bronze vessels of Urasz 
They made the tilimda vessels shine like silver barges 
After beer and liquor had been libated and enjoyed 
and after  from the house 
Enlil was made happy in Nibru 
Enlil addressed the Anuna gods 
My son King Enki has built up the temple 
He has built it in a pleasant place 
in Eridu the pure place where no one is to enter 
a temple built with silver and decorated with lapis lazuli 
a house which tunes the seven tigi drums properly and provides incantations 
where silver songs make all of the house a lovely place 
the shrine of the abzu the good destiny of Enki befitting the elaborate divine powers 
Father Enki be praised

For the mother of Ninazu Erekigal the recumbent one 
Her holy knees are not covered with a garment 
Her holy chest is not spread over with linen 
Enkidu did not accept the words of his master 
He wore his cleanest garment 
And therefore they marked him as a stranger 
He anointed himself with sweet oil from a stone vessel 
They flocked around him because of its scent 
Those who had been struck by a bowthrowstick flocked around him 
He put a willow stick in his hand 
Ghosts gathered up around him 
His put sandals on his feet 
He spoke aloud in the netherworld 
He kissed his beloved spouse 
He pelted the spouse he detested 
Did you see the man who had one child How has he fared 
A nail is fixed in his wall he makes a bitter cry 
Did you see the man who had two children How has he fared 
Upon two bricks he is sitting he is eating food

Why do you behave like this 
One has rejected the other cursed the other insulted the other 
You put an outcry in the scribal school 
By the possessor of a truthful heart he been taught Sumerian 
The sheaf that was not threshed his  which did not fall off 
You should be beaten on account of the output of this daily assignment  
Why the one who is your big brother 
And the one who knows the scribal art better than you 
Why did you speak with empty praise 
You have offended him you have cursed him you have insulted him 
And grew exceedingly angry saying do as you wish 
If you do as you wish 
Because of the fact that the one who acted like you offended his big brother 
After being struck with the tablet shaping board as a weapon sixty times 
Now the sin has been released for you

Now after you open a hole in the netherworld 
Bring up his servant from the netherworld 
The hero youth Utu the son given birth to be Ningal 
He opened up a hole in the netherworld 
By means of his breeze Utus son a dream god he brought it an aspect of Enkidu out from the netherworld 
He repeatedly hugged him and kissed him 
He was exhausting him with inquiries 
Would that you will speak to me would that you will speak to me 
You are someone that has seen the orders of the netherworld 
Would that you will speak to me would that you will speak to me 
Wise one you should not practice wisdom 
And I  
The intellect of a man is the domain of his god 
You should not kiss your beloved son 
You should not pelt your hated son 
The complaint of the netherworld would seize you 
Where will  be brought to how will  succeed

At that time he was able to decree a day scorching like  
The site of lagash It returned it to Elam in its own hand 
At that time the day of my lady was also not regularly performed

In its outskirts which had been made into a windblown plain

One who humiliates insulting woman 
Slanderer head striker 
Continually giving houses but not dwelling in the house of a man 
And you really are among women 
Filling water and roiling waterroiling clear water milling flour 
She leaned she diminished she milled 
She baked there she burned there 
She does not set that which she has created on its way 
You will reply to me 
An I want to follow of the wordspeech of humanity 
The one of collegiality the one who breaks words to pieces 
Her case is nonexistent and yet a garment has been worn 
Litigant who has approached the assembly the assembly  
She is confused she is shaking she is seeking aimlessly 
Litigant after you stand in  and  a word 
Pitfall hater you utter words 
They accept the  and chase her away 
And you are really of womanhood 
She has had no limit her womanhood is unsuitable 
She cannot comb her wool she cannot spin thread with the spindle 
When you stand in the street another abuses 
When you attempt to converse with praisequote a proverb it falls at the feet ie fails 
When you  towardson behalf of the assembly they take it seriously 
But after you turn away you are shameless   is laughing 
This is an insult that you make 
In a house where there is beer she is its trough 
In the house where there is soup she is its emerah jug 
In the house where there is food she is the chief cook 
She acts neighborly towards its master 
Entering into that house straightaway 
She is issuing orders and shouting 
Servile laborer of the steward bride the daughter of the house 
She smites their legslap 
She says to them Do not take anything everything that is here is mine 
And you  
Her house is a pigsty her inner room is a kiln 
A millstone is her husband the pounding stone is her son 
One who suckled among female slaves offspring of male slaves 
Your house was built by a female slave and cared for by a male slave 
Lunatic ecstatic conversing in an ecstatic state 
Saying I want to insult the words haven fallen out of the mouth 
Standing in the street prowling the street sitting at the threshold of men 
The tablet of fate deciding

 what will I do 
If  what will I do 
Because of you  touched the body 
You will say who are you giving orders to me 
 now I shall serve you 
You are to loiter about in the square 
If success is to be obtained you need to seek it 
Go to the edubaa school it will be good for you 
By means of a humanity that does not know your body 
Your heartanger and your reputation going apart from my headlead  
In excess of the time that I stand over you 
No one should stand over their son 
Your beatings of ie during instruction in which nothing compares with you 
You behave like someone who does not know the rules in your understanding you a not a man 
Among my colleagues comparing with each man I conducted and no one who compares with you is present 
This is what I recite to you 
By it wisdom is made from  inferiority 
It seizes the snake as if using incantationsmurmuring 
If a scribe knewlearned only one line of text 
And his hand was nevertheless very good 
He is a scribe 
If a singer knewlearned only one songhymn 
And his lamentvocalization was nevertheless good 
He is a singermusician 
 the provider  
Its standingserving  like a supreme ration  
At its great gate Enlil stood the door open in the wind 
In Ur no one went towards food no one went towards water 
Enlil made starvation in the form of an evil person dwell in the city 
He made that which before it a weapon does not stand against dwell in the city 
He made the hungryunsatfisfied and the eyeroller dwell in the city 
In Ur even the feardisdain of head shaking like a single planted reed was not established 
Its people took refuge like a caught fish 
Meager and great alike spread out no one arosewas mustered 
The king was mounted atop the gate tower there was no food there for him 
The sun was clouded over one was being enviouswatching and knew fasting 
There was no beer in the house of the plain its  was not present 
His supreme storehouse was not filled with grain no one could take refuge there 
The grain goddess was not present in the large and small grain heaps 
The afternoon meal of the gods was not eaten funerary offerings  
The giriPAa knife that consumes oxen and sheep  
In the great oven the oxen and sheep were not being prepared ie roasted one could no longer smell it 
The crybreath of the purearmed bursag buildingfunctionary stopped 
The temple that had once belowed like a bull  silently 
 did not execute deliveries properly  
The millstone the mortar and the pestle sat idle no one bends down towards them 
In the lapis harbor of Nanna boats were bound in the water due to silt 
The water of the prow did not scream it did not cast joy 
Sand was piled up in the unuRIbanda buildingshrine of Nanna 
Boats and barges quit the shining harbor 
like  his angry heart  
 do not  my  
 grasping a barbers razor during that night and day shall not  
 its hair not hanging a bitterpainful mouthword  
 like a child eating too much do not  my colon  
 like it was hanging from a saddle hook do not  on the ground 
 overwhelming distress  on my backin my liver 
 I am a juniorchild the one who does not  
 my king lying down like a bull 
Like a great meadow in which the carp flood expands 
The flooded field did not produce fish after the water drained 
The irrigated orchard did not produce syrup and wine 
He actively diminished your giguna and therefore should be madebound like Nibru 
In your city may headscorpses  in its wellsponds 
In conversing in ittranslating it 
At what time should he succeed 
You behave as if the regulations have never been taught 
In your  you are not a man 
Among my colleagues comparing with each man I conducted 
And no one who compares with you is present 
This is what I recite to you 
By it deafnessstupidity turns into wisdom 
By it wisdom is made from  inferiority 
It seizes the snake as if using incantationsmurmuring 
I have become weary of always having to beat you and have let that form of punishment go 
Bringing about reconciliation by means of lies I will not consent to you on this 
After I fill my heart and it overflows therefore I scorn you 
On your own behalf you have not ceased your wailing 
But I have set aside your wailing 
Because of the contentintent of what you are to speak 
And the fact that I go forth from according to my word 
In order to go away from according to my words here 
I am going away from here according to my words 
Because you have not observed your humanity reflected upon yourself 
You cannot pay attention to your humanity  
You wailing has finishedkilled me 
You make my heart go in the plain 
Because of what I am I did not send you as one charged with the task to carry reeds from the reed bed 
The  olddead reeds which even the tiny children carry 
Because of what you are you have not carried them 
In no wayat no time have I said Stand at the rear of an ox 
I did not send you as one charged with the task to hoe the field 
I did not send you as one charged with the task to sowcultivate the field 
I did not send you as a messenger charged with a task to do a task or to hoe 
Come After you do the work eat food 
Because of who you are you have not done the task but you did eat the food 
His father and mother will eat food 
If you observe the  of my colleagues 
Like ie each one of them ten gur of barley apiece they fill at the outsetper head 
Even the tiny ones the slave of their fathers 
Ten gur of barley apiece they place at the head ie provide 
They have givenbrought barley oilbutter and sheep wool 
As a man they exceed you 
You are not a man like each one of them 
Exceeding you they do not compare with you in the performance of assigned tasks 
Like them  
It was the frown of Enlil 
After it killed Kish like the bull of heaven 
After it slew the temple of Uruk in the dust like a great bull 
Where at that time to Sargon the king of Agade 
From the lowland to the highland 
After Enlil gave the enship and kingship to him 
At that time the sanctuary Agade holy Inanna  
May distress fall upon your palace which was built for rejoicing 
May the evildoer shout continually in the  plain 
In the site of your uzga where the cleansing rite had been established 
May the fox the one of the destroyed ruin mound drag its tail there 
 had grown thickened his neck a time that was not appointed  
 had grown thickened his neck a time that was not appointed  
The one white in the skin like a boxwood tree a time that was not appointed  
A form as if cast from a mold the statue the beautiful thing  
The one who is speckledfaced like a bison a time that was not appointed  
My beardedness that of my beautiful formstatue a time that was not appointed  
What did  do  
Enlil made starvation in the form of an evil person dwell in the city 
He made that which destroys cities that which destroys temples dwell in the city 
He made the hungrydissatisfied and the eyeroller dwell in the city 
In Ur even the feardisdain of head shaking like a single planted reed was not established 
Its people took refuge like a fish living in a wellpond 
Meager and great alike spread out no one arosewas mustered 
The king mounted atop the gate tower there was no food there for him 
The king who had ate and drank good things had to now clutch at a mere ration 
The sun was clouded over one was being enviouswatching and knew fasting 
He did not have beer in his brewery its  was not present 
There was no food for him in his palace it was not suitable for dwelling 
The grain goddess was not present in the large and small grain heaps 
The afternoon meal of the gods was actively diminished there 
In the great banquet the honeyed liquor ceased 
As for the giriPAa knife that consumes oxen and sheep it lay abandoned in the plants 
In the great oven the oxen and sheep were not being prepared ie roasted one could no longer smell it 
The crybreath of the purearmed bursag buildingfunctionary stopped 
The temple that had once belowed like a bull  silently 
The deposit of the properly executed deliveries was a distant memory 
The millstone the mortar and the pestle sat idle no one bends down towards them 
In the lapis harbor of Nanna boats were bound in the water due to silt 
The water of the prow did not scream it did not cast joy 
Sand was piled up in the unuRIbanda buildingshrine of Nanna 
The  rushes grew the  rushes grew the reed of mourning grew 
Boats and barges quit the shining harbor 
In your canal that was made suitable for barges no one was rowing anymore 
The plans of the festival at the place of rites was changed 
The nesag offering ships of his birth father Enlil no longer brought the nesag offering 
 could not bring its nindaba offerings to Nibru for him 
The cow was seized along with its calf 
The munzer fed cows took to a strange path in an unknown part of the plain 
Gayau who loves cows dropped his weapon in the beddingdung 
unidug the one who stores butter and cheese did not store butter and cheese 
People who did not know butter were churning its butter 
People who did not know milk were  its milk 
In the cattle pen the churning churn was not bellowing nobly 
The heavy coals that had been lit their smoke ceased 
Suen wept to his father Enlil 
My birth father my city was  for youhim why did you turn away from me 
Enlil my Ur was  for youhim why did you turn away from me 
The nesag offering ships of his birth father no longer brought the nesag offering for him 
 could not bring its nindaba offerings to Enlil at Nibru for him 
Ur like a city struck by a hoe has been broken up into ruin heaps 
The Kiur shrine the place of relaxation of Enlil has been made into a windblown shrine 
Enlil  your eye at your city it is an empty wasteland 
The dogs of Ur are not sniffing at the base of the city wall 
The one who burrowsdemarcates wells is not gathering earth at the market price 
My birth father turn around my city back to your arms from its loneliness 
Turn around my Ekinugal temple back to your arms from its loneliness 
So that my Ur is brought out so that the people are broadened 
So that he returns the me of Sumer which were destroyed to their place 
It is the 3rd kirugu 
Alas the true temple the true temple its man its man 
It is the gegigal response

And you fear your overseer 
Your overseer will love you 
If the objective is to be achieved when you speak to your companion 
Do not turn behind for him 
If you are going because the day is about to arrive 
How long shall I stay 
I knowuntil my master has left 
Because of what I am I did not send you as one charged with the task to carry reeds from the reed bed 
Because of what you are you have not carried them 
Regarding my field I did not send you as one charged with the task to hoe it 
Regarding my field I did not send you as one charged with the task to sowcultivate it 
I did not send you as a messenger charged with a task to do a task or to hoe 
Because of who you are you have not done the task but you did eat the food 
When a person like you does a task 
If you observe the  of my colleagues 
Like ie each one of them ten gur of barley apiece 
They place at the head ie provide 
Even the tiny ones the slave of their fathers ten gur of barley apiece they place at the head ie provide 
The ones who increase the amount of grain for their fathers 
They have givenbrought barley oilbutter and sheep wool 
As a man I exceed you 
You are not a man like each one of them 
My son their fathers 
Dispatched their childrenjuniors charged with a task 
My inferior like them 
They do not compare with you in the performance of assigned tasks 
Excessive is my exertion for you 
Who is it that has exerted himself for his son more that I 
My words which I recite to you are as follows 
It has not previously been the case Have fear It has not previously been the case Have shame 
Your companion with whom you are standing in the same yoke 
 your comrade your friend you do not observe them 
It has not previously been the case Now assimilate with your little brothers 
From the ranks of skilled humanity that resides in the land 
Come Enki himself has discovered that nothing that has a name among them 
Is as painstaking as the assigned task of the place of scribal art 
Nothing that could be named except for the art of the musician 
Like the shores of the sea where one shore is separated far away from the other 
Thus the content of the art of the musician is esoteric 
You can be idle for eternity 
Because your  reputation has not been smitten 
Because your reputation has not been beaten into the dust 
Because of what has been destroyed I will recite to you the following for my benefit 
What now to do 
What now to do 
That which I did was not  
Its stolen rushes  carried away the rushes  
 piled up and spread  out  in the manner of sheaves 
 a corpse was in the Euphrates  
 turned away from  and was not saying my spouse 
 turned away from  and was not saying my son 
The rich person took a different path away from his possessions 
 the hero  
 took a different path away from his beloved  
The one that is saying  my city 
Kazallu the city that teemed by itself was confused 
Numuda took a different path away from his city his beloved dwelling 
His wife Namrat the beautiful woman was weeping bitterly 
Emptiness was in the river  could not irrigate 
Like a river cursed by Enki its intake was blocked 
 The city that Enlil did not inquire  after 
The city that An frowned at 
The city that Nudimmud who was angry at 
The city that  fashioned a bitter fate  for 
The city in which the slave raises weapons against 
The city that the enemy did not quit the weapon against 
The city that  will say its young woman does not rejoice 
The city that  will say its young man does not rejoice 
The city whose trees and reeds are sick 
The city that  destroyed in battle 
The city that the slave beat the chest against in battle ie revolted 
The city that the spouse abandoned that the son abandoned 
The city that young woman abandoned the young man abandoned 
The deity of the temple  was not suitable for hisher temple anymore 
Heshe did not retain hisher possessions 
Its  did not wear a garment 
Its  did not eat bread 
Its dogs laid down among the corpses instead of devouring them 
The  birds were eating the corpses 
The men of the front died at the bow 
The men of the rear died at the stern 
In the middle of the city  destroyed the middle of the city 
In the outside of the city  destroyed the outside of the city 
In the harbor of my city  killed  
A  of clay will not be able to cross the river himself

In the  of of the windswept city the reed of mourning grows in lamentation 
In the  the reed of mourning grows in lamentation 
In the  he spends time in lamentation 
My son if you yourself are a native son then it is you who is the one whose tears they are 
Nanna if you yourself are a native son then it is you who is the one whose tears they are 
There is no revocation of a final verdict the word of the assembly 
The uttered word of An and Enlil knows no change 
From the distant day when the land was founded to the current limit of teeming people 
Who has seen a reign of kingship taking precedence forever 
In order to lengthen the term of kingship in order to take counsel to that effect 
My Nanna do not become exhausted doing this leave your city 
Lord Dilimbabbar fashioned a destroyedevil heart 
Nanna who loved his city left his city 
Ningal in order to go as a stranger of her city to a strange place 
Hurriedly she got dressedbraided a rope for escape and left the city 
The Anuna of Ur stood outside 
In Ur fire that  by itself was extinguished 
In Ur its trees were sick its reeds were sick 
A lament was competing with the wall up to its circuit in terms of completeness 
In Ur great hazin axes were sharpened before it 
They were setting the spears the arms of battle in order 
Great stones made a thudding pudpad noise by themselves 
In Ur the noble one divested of his strength stood among the murderers 
The enemy defeated the people those who stood among the weapons 
Starvation thus filled the city it was not ceasing 
In hunger they were bowing their heads and twisting their muscles 
Its people filled the ponds they were  
Its king breathed painfully in his own house 
Its humanity dropped their hands their weapons touched the ground 
They gatheredclasped their hands to their necks they were weeping 
Together they advised they discussed 
Alas what is it that we will say what is it that we will add 
How long until we are to be finished in the mouth of catastrophe 
The inside of Ur is death the outside is death 
How long until we are to be finished among the weapons of Elam outside the city 
Acting on behalf of their life and their back they spoke together 
Elam set foot there like a great onrushing flood 
In Ur they were crushing their heads with weapons like a porous pot 
Like fish living in a pond they were seeking refuge 
The enemy dwelled in the Ekinugal temple of Nanna 
They were breaking the holy having heavy possessions bird 
They cut down the statue that occupied the uzga shrine 
Nineigara the supreme steward abandoned the storehouse 
They seized the great cows atby their  horns  cut their horns off 
 smote goring bulls with the weapon like they were grazing sheep 
 was cut down and bound together like a date palm 
The date palm of like strong copper the arm of heroism 
It was torn out like a rush it was cut like a rush it was turned sideways in its roots 
Its top was lodged in the ground a person to raise it was not available 
 trimmed its midribs and set its top on fire 
 its spadix with ripe dates  the well 
The gizi reed that grew in the holy  were actively diminished

Why  the scribal art  
Come may you find its name 
Nothing named that could be named except for the art of the musician

They stood in the manner of one whose neck is pushed to the ground the enemies took them away 
He knelt there before his birth father Enlil

Examine faithfully your heart darkened by anger which terrifies like a wave 
Enlil was speaking a true word to his son Suen

My temple which was established by the just man 
Therefore the storm has beaten it at its outside 
In my Ekinugal the temple of kingship 
After being built falsely and destroyed truthfully  must not establish as its allocated share for me 
Therefore like a tent a building torn out at the harvest site like a building torn out at the harvest site it was subjected to wind and rain 
Urim my grain storage filled with food 
Therefore the empty wind howls in the silent city 
Like the sheepfold of the shepherd it was torn out 
The possessions which the city acquired for me are eradicated 
It is the 3rd kirugu refrain 
Urim has initiated lamentation to her detriment 
Her city is destroyed to her detriment her cosmic powers are changed to her detriment 
It is the gegigal response 
To the detriment of the lady her city is destroyed 
Her city is destroyed to her detriment her cosmic powers are changed to her detriment 
At that time this time after the city was created 
When they have ordered my city to be destroyed 
When they have ordered Urim to be destroyed 
At that time I will not be indifferent to my city 
I will not neglect my land 
For An I shall pour the tears of my eyes 
I shall say to himthem My city must not be destroyed 
I shall say to himthem Urim must not be destroyed 
I shall say to himthem Its people must not be killed 
Despite this An did not rescind his word 
Despite this the statement It is good so be it of Enlil was not soothing my heart 
Therefore when they have ordered my city to be destroyed 
When they have ordered its people to be killed 
For a 2nd time after they convened an assembly a solemn place 
The Anuna rested on the organized ie finalized word 
Therefore I shall extend my limbslap and tie up my hair 
For An I shall pour the tears of my eyes 
I shall supplicate myself to Enlil 
I shall say to himthem My city must not be destroyed 
I shall say to himthem Urim must not be destroyed 
Despite this the statement It is good so be it of Enlil was not soothing my heart 
Therefore when they have ordered my city to be destroyed 
When they have ordered Urim to be destroyed 
When they have ordered its people to be killed 
I as one who gave my advice to my detriment 
 therefore shall also bind me with my city 
 therefore shall also bind Urim with me 
An is never to change this word 
That which issues from the mouth of Enlil is not to be changed 
It is the 4th kirugu 
To the detriment of the lady her city is destroyed 
Her city is destroyed to her detriment her cosmic powers are changed to her detriment 
It is the gegigal response 
Enlil spoke to the storm and the people wailed 
He deprived the land of days of abundance and the people wailed 
He deprived Sumer of good days and the people wailed 
He commanded the malevolent storm and the people wailed 
He gave them to the kiggal official of the storm his attendant stormwho stood within the storm 
He spoke to the storm annihilating the land and the people wailed 
He spoke to the great storm the one of An and the people wailed 
Enlil was making Gibil fire into his helper 
He spoke to the great storm of An and the people wailed 
The great storm was shouting from above and the people wailed 
The storm annihilating the land roared upon the earth 
In the city the weapon was murdering and consuming as if in a pack 
At the base of heaven the storm gnawed and the people wailed 
The storm was burning with fire at its front and the people wailed 
And therefore the raging storm like a fireshade  at its back 
Midday which usually brings out bright sunlight brought darkness along with it 
The shining sun did not come out in the land it dissipated like the evening 
Burning sherds combined with the soil and the people wailed 
The storm blew a wind upon the blackheaded people and the people wailed 
Sumer was tripping as if in a gebur snare and the people wailed 
The eradicatinggathering storm was sweeping the landmaking the land tremble 
The storm utterly destroyed the city like a flood 
The storm that was finishing the land established silence in the city 
The storm burning like fire was enraged withcorporeally burned the peopleland 
The hateful storm ordered by Enlil the storm that  the land 
It covered Ur like a garment spread over it like linen 
It is the 5th kirugu 
The storm is a lion thrashing and the people wail 
It is the gegigal response 
At that time the storm was placed together with the city the city was ruin heaps 
Father Nanna the city has been placed into ruins and the people wailed 
The storm deprived the land of  and the people wailed 
The land was devastated until there was not even a broken sherd and the people wailed 
At the great gate where there was a path it was piling up corpses 
In the broad lane prepared as if for a festival heads were placed as seeds 
In the streets where there were paths it was piling up corpses 
In the playground where there was a festival it spread out people as sheaves 
Ditchesburial pits were put down for the blood of land like it would be done for the drainpipe of heaven 
That of the corpses like sheep fat in sunlight dissolved by themselves 
Like a man ended by a hazin axe one was not bothering to clothe his headwear a turban as a bandage 
Like a goat buck caught by a snare one lodged his mouth in the dirt 
And therefore like a man ended by the mitum weapon one did not bother to wear bandages 
As if lying in the birthing place of their mother one laid in his blood 
Those who had not drunk wine nonetheless hung their necks down lit on the shoulder 
Those who served with weaponry were slaughtered by weaponry 
The storm took away fugitive men and gazelles alike and the people wailed 
In Urim the weak and strong alike came to an end out of hunger 
The elder women and men who did not leave the house were set on fire 
Water brought away the tiny ones  from the lap of the mother like fish 
The strong grasp of the wetnurse this grasp was loosened 
Allegiancesense was forgotten and the people wailed 
The treasury of the land was eradicated and the people wailed 
Possessed of everything and anything of the cosmic powers 
Girded with ancient designs 
Southern storm that covers the four corners of the world 
On behalfbecause of the  of Enlil 
Thus An spoke faithfully to be 
Thus An spoke faithfully to be 
Thus An spoke faithfully to be 
And gave my hand the staff and noserope 
And gave my hand the staff and noserope 
Thus he Nuska established these things by means of making the heart of Enlil rejoice 
Thus Ninurta mighty hero of Enlil submitted a matter to Nunamnir 
Thus Ninurta mighty hero of Enlil submitted a matter to Nunamnir 
Thus Ninurta mighty hero of Enlil submitted a matter to Nunamnir 
Measured for himself  the good words of ie to win over Enlil and Ninlil on my behalf

The land was devastated until there was not even a broken sherd left and the people wailed 
A breach was made in the wall and the people wailed 
At the great gate where there was a path it was piling up corpses

And therefore the possessions  amassed there were annihilated 
In the treasury which had possessed  plundered itself 
Even in the ponds Gibil the purifier was performing work 
The high mountain range which no hand approaches oh lord of the Ekinugal temple 
The true temple the great hazin axes were consuming as if in a pack 
The troops of imagi and Elam the destructive ones were treating it as if it was worth thirty shekels 
When the pickaxes struck the true temple and city the people wailed 
They were making the city into ruin heaps and the people wailed 
Its lady was crying Alas my city she was crying Alas my temple

In its course it does not bring flowing water its canal inspector is not present 
In my field like a field that the pickax has struck to destroy it and render it unusable only the star of the field plant grows 
In the irrigated orchards that heap up syrup and wine the thornbush of the mountain grows grows 
In the steppe whose joy was surpassingfilled it it was emitting a baking scent like an oven

I am Ezina born for the hero who will never cease 
Who can stand against Ikur as an equal opponent 
The churn and the kir vessel for milk the treasure of shepherdship are present among your property 
What of yours can be present in response What is it that which is my speaking that can be responded to Answer 
For a 2nd time lahar was answering Ezina 
You have loved the  of the mountainforeign land 
The one with a junior spouse the  with lit of small children 
One takes you down to the site of the threshing floor 
One takes you up from the site of the threshing floor 
His weapon has struck your face it has struck your nose 
After  like crushedslaughtered

When you live in the trough 
One mixed you with the dough for me and curled it up on the ground 
The young woman is the one who spreads outbakes mixes and spreads out againstrikes 
She brings you up to the oven 
When you are on the table 
I am there above relative to you and you are there below relative to me 
Ezina pay attention to yourself 
And then you will understand you  
Because the eye  your me ie role 
And then I am made to follow after as a course 
The miller is not there for evil purposes for what he does 
What of yours can be present in response What is it that which is my speaking that can be responded to Answer 
As for you Ikur is your master Sumuqan is your groom and the desert is your bed 
Like when locusts afflict a house with their teeth 
You bring the weak cripple into the land 
While I can set my neck to the ground ie achieve a state of overripeness 
I am divided into various  ban containers 
After one has brought your  bellyinnards for sale at the market rate 
After he binds you yourselfyour aura and your neck with a loin cloth 
At that time Enki was speaking to Enlil 
Father Enlil lahar and Ezina  
They have stood  by their strength 
The 3rd3th  does not cease at their side 
Of the two of them Ezina is greater 
And therefore Lahar should kneel and prostrate herself to Ezina 
From sunrise until sunset 
The one who possesses silver the one who possesses lapis the person that possesses an ox the person who possesses a sheep 
In the dispute undertaken between lahar and Ezina 
Lahar is the quitter Ezina is the one who emerged victorious 
Father Enki praise

The junior Enlil of the lands he was the 3rd one 
He sought the me of both heaven and earth and founded a dwellingsitting there 
The water that engenders the true seed was bound to his hand 
The Tigris and Euphrates having been excavated on the edge brought water into the lands 
He dredged the small canals the ditches were established there 
 Enki broadened the cattle pen and sheepfold he made them acquire a shepherd and cow herder 
He established cities and outlying settlements on the earth the blackheaded flourished there 
He made the king acquire their shepherdship he raised him to their princeship 
He brought out the king as faithful sunlight in the lands 
Enki knotted the marshes together he made the old reed growth and fresh reed stalks grow 
He made fish and birds live in the great marshes the ponds and the supreme marshes 
Nudimmud the supreme prince the lord of broad wisdom 
After he created both the fish and the bird 
He chose their station on behalf of you  
He made their eyes discover their design 
At that time the fish laid eggs in the deep watermarsh 
The fish stood he was shouting to the bird 
It arose in the street in the manner of a quarrel it stood there wildly 
At that time the fish was speaking to the bird in the deep watermarsh with an outcry 
Bird releasing ie uninhibited shouting  was not presentplaced

Bring out a pit in the sand dunes thus is what is appropriate for you 
At that time the fish insulted the bird 
Because of its beauty the bird knew about its multicolored back and multicolored face 
Whatever insults fish had assailed it with it did not ponder them 
It was as if a nursemaid was singing a lullaby 
It was not heeding these words laughing malevolently instead 
At that time the bird was replying to the fish 
Thus your heart produces exuberance you have actually humilated yourself

But there is no one who has prepared the working of your pure waxmold 
Fruits of the orchard are for my many regular offerings 
Thus you do not know my greatness Bow your neck to the ground 
At that time the bird insulted the fish 
Like a heavy rain cloud it touched the ground it stood in an adamin contest 
Whatever insults the bird had struck it with it did not ponder 
It was able to set its neck on the ground sarcastically it was speaking freelyhumbly 
For the 2nd time the fish replied to the bird 
Bird you do not know my greatness you did not tread behind me you are one who has not inquired after me 
Possessor of trimmed limbs crippled feet a  mouthbeak and a thinned outflattened tongue 
By means of ignorance you have been able to sneershoutchew but you have not advised yourself

Bird what is your great thing that you accomplished I will make you known your over exuberance 
At that time the fish was to make plans against the bird 
Silently and deceptively it went on its arms 
The fish sought the place silently 
It struck the birds established nest its prepared plants making it a windswept shrine 
It destroyed its built house it tore out its storeroom 
It killed its eggs and its nest with water it covered them in the sea 
For a 2nd time the fish insulted the bird 
At that time the bird with the face of a pirig creature and the claws of a hurin bird 
It was beating its wings towards its nest but its flight path was blocked 
With its mouth it was screaming in the midst of heaven like the nugig midwife of heaven ie Inanna 
At that time the bird which was looking carefully its limbs were spread out 
Like a stormwind that is to shake to the midst of heaven it roamed in heaven 
It seized it it tried to flee in the water but the bird held it with its claws 
It heaped up its little spawn together it heaped them in the manner of sheaves 
The bird took out revenge but its heart was not cooling 
For a 2nd time the bird was replying to the fish 
Clever one inferior one deaf one with muddled plans fish you should not come out 
Roaming the harbor its mouth not eating a storm blowing away fodder 
Pig rogue eating its own excrement  
Guard who dwells in a boundup house slithering by itself 
The fish burned  for me like fire it sought the place silently 
Out of ignorance it got angry it spattered its hands in blood 
In making itself feel wonderful it has destroyed itself

Bringing anger to the rebel land gathering up the assembly 
Ninurta the king the son who profoundly humbles himself to his father 
When he occupied the throne upon the supreme dais when he bore a great aura 
When he initiated a festival when he rejoiced when he sat broadly 
When he was rivaling An and Enlil when he was to be sweetened by liquor 
When Bau was to plead with arazu prayers of the king 
When Ninurta the son of Enlil was to determine fate 
At that time the weapon of the lord looked at the mountain 
arur above on the one hand was speaking to the king 
Lord of heavenly station who occupies the dais in the assemblythrone room 
Ninurta you utterance never wavers your decreed fate is put faithfully in effect 
Ninurta it gave birth to a warrior that knows no fear the Asag

A youth that has left his scentsweat ie has no odor possessor of a face that has no shame 
Ninurta one that lifts itself and rejoices with its form

Its power makes the city and its gods bow to the ground 
My king this one has cast down a dais its slacked arm does not relent 
Ninurta lord it has decided its cases just like you 
Against the Asag against its aura who penetrates with their hand 
My lord the mountain has conveyed its nindaba offerings to that place 
Hero it has inquired about you because of your father your lineage 
Son of Enlil lord it has sought after your location because of your supreme power 
My king it has advised you because of your might

Dilimbabbar has not undertaken my case 
If he did what is to me If he did not what is it to me 
Victorious he Lugalane drove me out from the temple 
He removed the true crown of the en priestess from my head 
Most precious lady loved by An 
May your holy heart which is supreme be restored to its place for me 
Beloved spouse of Amauumgalana Dumuzi 
Who is the great queen of the horizon and zenith ie the whole of heaven 
The Anuna have submitted to you 
Since birth you have been the younger sister of Utu 
And thus you have been superior to the Anuna the great gods 
The Anuna kiss the ground with their lips for you 
My case has not been finalized but the threat of a hostile decision like my case lingers in my face 
The enemy and the evildoer have not escaped its grasp 
Which has made righteousness and justice into a treasure 
Where clean clothes are at the quay 
The older brother is to honor the younger brother and behave with humanity 
One is to listen to the word of the father and thus succeeds repays himself 
The son is to humbly revere his mother so that he endures until his old age 
It is at the holy city and settlement of Enlil

In the Ekur the supreme shrine he has sat on its dais 
No one can disperse the cosmic powers of that temple 
Its pure place of washing rites like the earth does not cease 
Its cosmic powers are the cosmic powers of the Abzu which no one is to see 
Its aura touches heaven 
And therefore its sacred space opens up towards the midst of heaven

May the seven musicians singplay 
The utterance of Enki which is not to be changed 
 is set towards its proper place 
He is singing sweetly about the brickwork of the Eengura temple 
WhenIn that which he had built the temple in that he had built the temple 
In that which Enki had raised in Eridu 
Likeas a mountain range that is craftily knottedequipped with stairs it floats on the water 
The suhur carp plays in the ulal plants 
The etub carp flap their tails for him towards the tiny gizi reed grouth 
When Enki rises the fish rise as a wave 
In the Abzu he stands amid admiration 
Like the sea he can possess an aura 
He is a supreme river who can cast a radiance 
In the Euphrates river he can raise a furious southern wind 
His boat pole is his serpent Nera 
His oars are his little kib birds 
When Enki sails the year is filled with abundance 
The boat released itself and seized its own ropes 
In the river  was advising its king 
The one whose voice was the voice of a calf the voice of a sweet cow 
Enki was slaughtering bulls and slaughtering sheep 
He restored the ala drum that was not present to its proper place 
He was entering into the giguna terrace of shrine Nibru 
Enki approached the beer he approached the kurun liquor 
He poured yellow kurun liquor into a bronze bowl 
He made kukurdu containers settle inwith the residue of the very goodsweetened beer 
He released the residue by cooling it making it into that which is mixed 
Enki who was in shrine Nibru 
He seated  An in what was the supreme place 
For An he made Enlil follow there 
He seated Nintur in the seat of honor lit greater side 
He sat the Anuna gods in their foundations 
They lit the people were drinking they were making themselves sweetwith kurun liquor 
They were rolling around ie knocking over the bronze vessels likefilled with apples 
They were making the bronze bowls have a contest with Ura ie the earth by knocking them onto the ground 
They were  the bowl shaped like the holy barge ie the crescent moon 
After beer was drunk and kurun liquor was enjoyed 
After they set foot away from the temple 
Enlil  rejoicing in Nibru 
Enlil was speaking to the Anuna 
It was a good place that he built the temple in 
In Eridu the pure place which no one is to enter 
The temple built in silver and made colorful in lapis 
The temple that plays the seven tigi drums properly and produces incantationsnamub prayers 
The pure and dignified ir songs that make the temple site sweet

You are Inanna the one who has desired the mountain but what will its midst accomplish 
You are the one who has desired the mountain range of Ebih but what will its midst accomplish 
The abodestation of the gods is imposed with a furious aura 
And thus a radiance is released upon the holy dwelling of the Anuna 
The redfurious aura of the mountain range is imposed upon the lands

My son like her son I unlike her  
Have not abused she behaved as a prostitute towards me she has divorced her spouse 
Undertake proper legal action against her 
Who is she Ninkuzu daughter of my lord 
Holy Inanna acted as her pleasure 
She wentstood among the mountain range of Ebih and spoke to him 
Mountain range on account of your raising on account of your being high 
On account of your being beautiful on account of your being verdant 
On account of your setting a hand straight away into heaven 
On account of your not bringing your nose close to the ground 
They killed you and one of them stripped you naked 
Like an elephant one seized your tusks 
Like a great wild bull like a thick horned one  touched the ground  
Like a bull I cast down  towards your massive horns  founded hatred for you 
 filled your eyes with weeping 
In is outskirts the bird of despair founded a nest 
A 2nd time she made a wishrejoiced at the furious aura she boasted faithfully 
My father Enlil has imposed my great aura in the lands 
He placed a weapon at my right arm 
At my left arm I  on a sealtablet 
My rage a harrow with large teeth tears apart the mountain 
 built a palace and did surpassing things 
 set up a throne there I will make its foundations firm 
 gave the knife and the dagger to the kurgara performer 
 gave the em and lilis drums to the lamentation priest 
My triumph went against the mountain 
Like an overflowing flood it broughtpoured high waterirrigated the u land 
Like a rising flood it twisted ie cleaned the immense cloth 
My triumph stood in the mountain 
My triumph stood in Ebih 
I will drop into the tiny plants no one should find my whereabouts 
I will drop into the large plants no one should find my whereabouts 
I will drop among the dikes of Arali no one should find my whereabouts

I am Shulgi after I was born I was a mighty male 
I am a pirig creature with a furious face that was given birth to by an uumgal creature 
I am the king of the 4 quarters 
I am the herder and shepherd of the blackheaded 
I am the child born of Ninsumun

I am the mighty king of Nanna 
I am the openmouthed pirig creature of Utu 
I am Shulgi whose allure was chosendiscovered by Inanna 
I am a girnun equid suitable for the road 
I am a male donkey of Sumuqan seeking to run 
I am the knowledgable scribe of Nisaba 
Like my heroism and my strength 
Intelligence is therefore perfected 
Therefore justice is loved 
Therefore evil is not loved 
Because I am rejoicing at my might and shoulder strength 
I establish the length of the doublehour and had palaces built there at that interval 
I establish the length of the doublehour and had palaces built there at that interval 
Therefore shall relax towards its cool side 
The male going on the road who otherwise spends the night on the road 
Therefore has taken refuge there as if it was his built city 
So that my name is established to distant time so that it is not dropped byfrom the mouth 
I am possessed of speed I muster up my strength I am  running 
My heart therefore spoke to me in order to make a round trip as if it was only one doublehour 
A pirig creature not tiring by means of its youth I am one who stands in its strength 
My little niglam garment was suitable on my hips 
Therefore like a  wild dove flying furiously I pumped my arms 
Therefore like the Anzud bird raising its eye towards its mountain I spread my knees apart in stride 
Therefore the cities of the land that I founded served me 
Therefore my blackheaded people teeming like ewes look to me sweetly 
As Utu broadening the daylight upon the settlements 
Therefore I was entering the Ekinugal temple 
Therefore the em and ala drums resounded 
Therefore the tigi drum the good thing was played properly there 
I am Shulgi the one who makes anythingfood numerous and therefore food offerings were offered there 
When I roused myself from the  cultic area like a pirig creature 
Ikur shouted in the broad heavens 
Its small and large hailstones 
Therefore made a thud on my back 
I am a king who therefore could not be frightened or have gooseflesh 
Like a fierce pirig creature I therefore snarled 
Therefore as an equid of the plain I galloped 
Therefore with my heart with happiness inside of it I was running 
When I ran as a perfect male donkey 
And thus I had made the round trip the journey being 15 doublehours 
My sagursag performers saw the feat 
It was one day I performed the ee festival in both Nibru and Urim 
It was the palace founded by An therefore I drank beer there with him 
Therefore my singer performed my song at the seven tigi drums 
My spouse the young maiden Inanna the lady who is the allure of the universe 
She sits with me in eating and drinking 
Thus my raised eye goes where it wishes 
Thus my free will confronts what it wishes 
My fixed sayingsaffairs that were written 
By the life of my father holy lugalbanda 
And Nanna the king of the universe 
 to distant days 
Thus there has not been a king  like me among the people 
Thus there has not been a king  like me among the people 
An has firmly placed a golden crown on my head 
Thus in the shining Ekur I seized the scepter 
Thus my power was exalted in the kingship 
Therefore may my name be invoked among the cared for people of the four regions 
Therefore they shall perform my pure songs 
Therefore they shall discover my greatness 
The one taken care of with the great might of kingship 
Given supreme strength by Nunamnir 
Shulgi the destroyer of the enemy land the establisher of the land 
The iib priest of the universe who has no rival 
Shulgi cared for by the noble son of An

Therefore has taken refuge there as if it was his built city 
So that my name is established to distant time so that it is not dropped byfrom the mouth 
I am possessed of speed I muster up my strength so that my running is tested 
From Nibru to the brickwork of Urim 
Therefore my heart resolved to make the round trip as if the journey was one doublehour 
A pirig creature not tiring by means of its youth I am one who stands by itself 
My little niglam garment was suitable on my hips 
Like a  wild dove flying furiously I pumped my arms 
Therefore the cities of the land that I founded stood for me 
Therefore my blackheaded people teeming like ewes look to me sweetly 
Like a goat of the mountain range that is running to its dwelling 
As Utu broadening the daylight upon the settlements 
Therefore I was entering the Ekinugal temple 
Therefore bulls were slaughtered there sheep were slaughtered there 
Therefore the em and ala drums resounded 
I am Shulgi the one who makes anythingfood numerous and therefore I offered food offerings there 
When I roused myself from the  cultic area like a pirig creature 
It was in the Egalmah temple of Ninegala 
Therefore I relaxed there I bathed there with flowing water 
Therefore I bend the knee there and ate food there 
Therefore I was arising like a harrier and a falcon 
At that time the storm therefore shouted the stormwind circled 
Therefore flashing lighting wreaked havoc in heaven together with the seven winds 
The beautiful Nanibgal Nisaba 
Gave wisdom and intelligence generously to me 
When I rose as if possessing the musculature of a leopard 
The heart of An brought rejoicing for me 
They gave me a scepter because of my justice 
I was able to step on the neck of the lands 
 put the fame of my weapon to the Lowland 
After I go out into combat and battle 
To the place that Enil has grown angry at  
I go at the front of my troops 
It is I who puts passion into the weapon 
I am in possession of the spear and the masatum weapon 
My discharged destructive clay bullets and pellets 
The ones that are to fly like an aura bearing northern storm 
In my anger I do not let them pass their mark 
I give fear and distress to the enemy land 
My brother and friend who is the youth Utu 
I looked to him in a place of encouragementvitality 
I am Shulgi I speak a word with him openly 
He is the beautifulfaced god of my battle 
The youth Utu who makes a brother love a brother is the protective spirit of my weapon 
Because of his word I will be strong I will be mighty  
As ie like my brother and friend Utu 
Of my dust covered equids screaming like ug creatures I am their good groom 
Like a male donkey my strength never wavers as a runner 
I come out ahead from the other runners 
My word is something never to be abandoned by the mouth 
I am a ritually pure diviner 
I am the Nintur mother goddess of the procedures of omens 
In order to perfect the lustration rites of the iib priesthood 
In order to praise the en priestess and install her on behalf of the gipar building 
To advance towards the lowland and inflict defeat against the highland 
To open the house of the emblem 
To wash the lance with the water of battle 
To enact clever plans in the rebel land 
The words of the gods is a most precious thing for these matters 
After I establish an oracular utterance within the white lamb the sheep suitable for extispicy 
After I pour water and ea flour in the place where the name is utteredthe oath is taken 
I will prepare the sheep withaccording to the words of the siskur ritual 
My diviner  there like a barbarian 
The prepared sheep passes into my hand 
I do not hold good omens with bad omens 
A brilliant mind is mine I go by my own eyes 
I am the king the entrails of a single sheep 
I see the orders of the whole world 
I shall boast about my deeds 
My intellect is full of cleverness 
What of mine does not surpass description 
And therefore I am devoted to the art of the musician 
Nothing about it is blocked to me 
I have learned the depth and width of tigi and adab songs or instruments perfected byequipped for the musicians craft 
The playing of the ukar instrument was grasped in the mind 
In order to adjust the frets I did not cause the arm to break 
I made plans fordrew its raising and lowering 
I have known how to tune the three  gu instrument and the lyre well 
I have known the fingering techniqueplectrum of the algar and sabitum instruments which the king created 
I accepted the Mari instrument that which silences the temple 
The king Urzababa instrument the harhar instrument the harhar instrument 
The lion instrument the post of the boatman instrument and zanaru instrument I brought out their noises  
Like a purehandedskilled member of the musicians 
If someone brings a gudi instument never heard before to where I am my place 
When I make it speak its essence is made known 
I can make it like something at its appropriate time 
I do not play the reed flute like a mere reed pipe of the shepherd 
Intoning a umuna song wailing in lament 
In the heart I have known how to do this like one who does it regularly 
I am one who causes rejoicing I am one who makes things sweet 
I am one who spends the day in joy and princeliness 
If a man pays attention to his fear 
The circumscribed limits of life 
He is one who trusts in his own might 
And thus one who trusts his great name 
Makes everything the best why would he diminish them 
Total 61 lines 
I have known how to impose the meaning of the words I am not freed 
My words are the finest of pressedhigh quality oils 
A heart that burns like fireI have known its cooling 
One will weigh my words against a man excessive in words 
I am a man of the most precious things 
The importance of being humbled is appreciated by me 
One cannot slanderalter anything of mine 
By the word of An and Enlil 
I shall cover my mouth in submission for the life of the homeland and the life of the foreign lands 
I am their unceasing one their unfailing one 
I too have known how to serve the gods 
I have known the cooling place of the Anuna 
I am Shulgi whose great neck grows thick in princeliness 
When I am able to have great things 
Rejoicing is able to be in my heart 
Or a single king from ancient times 
That which accrued after mankind was placed from heaven on the earth 
I am not a barbarian regarding this accumulated knowledge 
From cultic songs of the present time to ancient ones of distant days 
At no time have I chosen themuttered falsely or blocked them in the mouth 
Therefore I have inquired after these ancient things and not given them over to be abandoned 
Therefore I made my irgida songs manifest in my good palacetemple 
Therefore the  of the tigi and zamzam songsinstruments everything I embedded in my memory 
That which was thus not dropped from the hand 
 will not release
