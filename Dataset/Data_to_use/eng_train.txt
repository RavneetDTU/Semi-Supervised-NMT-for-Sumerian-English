At that time there was a princely land among the cities
Inab was this princely land among the cities

One day as the evening came when they had reached
when they have reached the place of rations
The ration of a married man was established as double
the ration of a man with a child was established as triple
the ration of a single man was established as single
but the ration of Martu though being single was also established as double
Martu went home to his own mother
He entered the house before her and spoke to her
In my city I am among my friends and they all have already married wives
I am there among my mates and they all have already married wives
I am single and I have no children
Yet the imposed share exceeds that of my friends
over and above that of my mates I received half of theirs
the place of rations when they had reached it
The ration of a married man was established as double
the ration of a single man was established as single
but the ration of Martu though he was single was also established as double
Martu to his own mother
he entered the house before her and spoke to her
My mother find me a wife to marry and I will bring you my ration
His own mother replied to Martu
Suenuna my son I will give you advice may my advice be heeded
I shall say a word to you you should pay attention to it
Marry a wife of your choice
marry a wife of your hearts desire
give me thus a companion  me a slavegirl
Having built the houses of  your people living around the city and  gardens
you will dig the wells of  your mates
a festival was announced in the city of Inab Martu said
Come friends let us go let us go there

The god Numuda participated in the festival
his beloved daughter Adgarkidug participated in the festival
girdled champions
entered the wrestling house 
to compete with each other in the temple of Inab
There were many coming to Inab the city where the festival was taking place to marvel at this
There were many coming to Inab the city where the festival was taking place to marvel at this
For Numuda because he was holy   
to compete in wrestling at the gate of Inab
Martu too strode around the great courtyard
They kept looking for strong fighters for him
they kept offering him strong fighters
Martu strode around in the great courtyard
He hit them  with a destructive  
In the great courtyard in the battle he caused them to be bandaged
Numushda rejoicing over Martu
offered him silver but he would not accept it
Having done so a second time
having done so a third time Martu says
Where does your silver lead Where do your jewels lead
I Martu would rather marry your daughter
I would rather marry your daughter Adgarkidug
Numuda says You  the wife with calves as a marriage gift 
Milk cows shall feed the calves
In the byre the breeding bull shall lie down

You must give your word thus and only thus
and then I will give you my daughter Adgarkidug

They never stop roaming about 
they are an abomination to the gods dwellings
Their ideas are confused they cause only disturbance
He is clothed in sackleather 
He lives in a tent exposed to wind and rain and cannot properly recite prayers
He lives in the mountains and ignores the places of gods
He digs up truffles in the foothills does not know how to bend the knee
He eats raw flesh
He has no house during his life

the dragonface of a man causing evil 
approached heaven and the clouds bring no rain 
He approached the earth and the plants do not grow 
He approached the ox and its yoke does not open
he approached the maiden and tossed away her towel 
He approached the nurse with the child  her arms were torn apart
He approached the vegetables  lettuce and cress became bad
He approached the garden the fruit became bad
The eye of the mountain came out from the mountain
The wild ram let its shining horns come out
May the evil eye like the sick eye be cut off
May it go to pieces like the potters burzipot on the market place
While standing while standing
while standing at the mouth of the street
it opposes the young man who has no personal god
Let the eye turn into a wind

Now today that of the horizonentire earth everything 
The field ripened withplaced barley 
The harvest of the irrigated orchard yielded fruit 
He heaped up the grain piles 
The lord brought up harborstrading colonies from within the land 
He made the mood of the gods pleasant 
And they were praising Ninurta and his father Enlil 
At that time he also reached a compassionate state for the woman 
Ninmah because of the place where  had sex with her was not sleeping 
She was greatly intoning a lament in the mountain that had not been stepped onhad no trails 
The mountain does not bear the supreme strength of the lord 
The hero who like An in his anger his might no one approaches

The lord was speaking to the emery stone he was wishing forobserving its path 
In the homeland the angry lord spoke a word to him 
Ninurta lord son of Enlil was cursing him 
Emery stone you who the Asag mustered against me in the mountain 
As one who seized  in order to renderplace my hands  
As one who swore to commit my murder 
As one who terrified me lord Ninurta in my own supreme dwelling

Leopards that rely on their strength shall tear you up 
The powerful one shall accept a test of strength with you 
Young man emery your brothers shall heap you like flour 
You young man your shout shall be present and tremble but it shall end 
You shall raise a hand violently against your offspring show the teeth against their corpses 
Like a great bull killed by many mena slaughterer make yourself intoset yourself apart as something divided into shares 
Emery by means of the weapon dog away from battle 
I am the lord you shall be named according to your having pecked atdemolished carnelian 
Today and henceforth when emery touches another stone it will be in order to perforate carnelian thus it is so 
My king attended to the eleli stone

May the land admire you sweetly the foreign lands shall raise you 
The hero attended to the kagina stone 
He spoke to it because of its might 
Ninurta the son of Enlil was decreeing its fate 
Reverent youth who sets saturated light to the outside

My hand did not conquer you as an arrogant one 
And therefore I did not bind you together with the hostile ones 
The guggazi and marhali stones

The egizaga girinhiliba anzugulme and nirmuir stones 
The lord

As a witness you boasted about meyourself

You pl shall faithfully care for gold which you are inlaid with 
Among the  of the gods 
The lands shall touch the nose in submission when you grovel 
My king attended to the flint he looked at it angrily 
At that time Erekigal slapped her thigh 
At that time Erekigal slapped her thigh 
She bit her lip and considered the news 
She was speaking to Biti her chief gatekeeper 
Pay attention to what I have said to you 
She shall drag the bolts of the seven gates of the netherworld from their lock 
She shall push the single door of the palace of Ganzer push open 
The man took away her split apart skin 
What is going onis thishe doing 
Be satisfied Inanna This is the rite of the netherworld that is being completed 
Inanna This is the procedure of the netherworld you should not speak aloud 
Her sister raised her up from her throne 
She sat down apart from her throne 
The seven judges of the Anuna were judging her 
Their decision was one of embittered anger 
 it was embittered anger 
 struck her and turned her into a smitten piece of meat 
She repeatedly made the lament of ruin heaps for her 
She circled the temples of the gods for her 
She scratched her face she scratched her nose 
Her fingernails were lodged in her flesh like lubi axesagricultural implements 
Her fingernails were lodged in her flesh like lubi axesagricultural implements 
She trimmedthe hair on her head like leeks 
When she says alas my heartliver 
They said to her you are weary our lady is the reason for your alas my liver 
From my heart to your heart from my liver to your liver  
If you are human I shall decree a fate of death for you 
They swore by the life of heaven and earth that they were gods 
 were to gobring outup 
Barley of the field was offered to them but not accepted 
They were saying to her give us the beaten meat hanging from the beam 
 the meat that was beaten was that of their lady 
Linen does not spread over her holy knees 
Linen does not spread over her holy knees 
Her chest does not protrude like a flask 
her hair is plucked like leeks upon her head 
When she cries alas my heart 
When she cries alas my liver 
say you are exhausted from saying alas my liver 
She will say Who are you 
Speak to my heart my heart to my liver my liver 
If you are gods I will speak a word to you 
if you are humans I will determine your fate of death 
Invoke the life of heaven and earth in an oath 
The river water will be offered to you but not accepted 
Say Give the beaten meat that hangs from the peg 
The beaten meat was their lady 
Say that whether it is the king or the queen give it to us 
You will give the beaten meat hanging from the peg 
They will have cast upon her it was one with the food of life it was one with the water of life 
and Inanna will stand alive again 
Bring their lady  
Inanna brought from the netherworld by the orders of Enki 
When Inanna ascended from the netherworld Anuna seized her 
Saying Who is it that ascends from the netherworld who is brought up from the netherworld intact 
If Inanna is to be brought up from the netherworld 
she is to give an ablebodied replacement on her own head 
The one before her although he was not a vizier held a weapon 
The one before her although he was not a vizier held a weapon 
The one behind her although he was not a vizier  
The small galla demons as a ukur enclosure the large galla demons as a dubban fence held fast at her side 
They came for her 
They came for Inanna 
They lifted the child from the lap of a man they tore away the spouse from the lap of a man 
They drove out  from her quarters 
 went towards Inanna 
She sat in the dirt she wore a filthy garment 
The galla demons spoke to holy Inanna Inanna go towards your city we shall take him away as a corpse 
Holy Inanna replied to the galla demons My  
My flattering vizier my rider of the verified word 
My  the word 
When she initiates the lament of the ruin heaps play the em drum of the assemblythrone room 
When she circled the temples of the gods she scratched her face for me she scratched her nose for me

He is scratching   my hairdresser 
How could I give him as a corpse to you 
We shall go to Badtibira and the Emukalama temple 
Lulal fell before her 
Lulal sat in the dirt 
Lulal wore a dirty garment 
The galla demons were speaking to Inanna Inanna go to your city

Holy Inanna replied to the galla demons 
Lulal fixed at my right side 
Lulal fixed at my left side 
Lulal fixed at my outer pillaras my foremost one 
 why would I give him to you 
Let us go to the great apple tree in the plain of larsa 
Dumuzi sat upon the supreme dais 
He sat in splendor in the seat 
A prostitute held his thigh tightly 
 poured out the seven churns 
 shook the head at him 
The shepherd was not playing the reed pipe  
She looked at him it was the look of death 
She shook her head at him it was the headshake that accused one of grievous sin 
Holy Inanna was replying to the galla demons 
 who is one of the ones who came towards him 
 you will not release him 
They seized  
He was the man among those whom the lady compelled to come towards him 
They came towards Dumuzi 
Dumuzi wept he was emitting sobs 
Thus the youth What has been done what  
 who is to die 
He raised his hands heavenwards for Utu 
I am the one who brings butter to the temple of your mother 
I am the one who brings cream to the temple of Ningal 
I am the one who brings  to  
I am the one who makes the bridal payment on behalf of Unug 
I am the one who plays among the holy knees of Inanna 
After you prepare my hands as those of a gazellesnake 
I shall escape my galla demon they shall not seize me 
Utu accepted his tears 
He prepared his hands as those of a gazellesnake 
He prepared his feet as those of a gazellesnake 
I shall escape my galla demon they shall not seize me 
Holy Inanna wept bitterly for her spouse

As members of the wise men  
Thus was the decreed fate of Inanna 
 Inanna was weeping 
You when the year is half completed your sister when the year is half completed 
The days that you desireare requested those days shall be of captivity 
your praise is sweet 
Total one hundred seventy three lines 
The 3rd in a series of singlecolumn extracts in its entirety text with the incipit from great heaven towards great earth 
The junior galla demon opened his mouth and was speaking to the eldest galla demon 
The galla demons entered Unug and were seizing Inanna there 
Go to the place you have plotted against descend to the netherworld 
Go to the place of Erekigal descend to the netherworld 
You should not wear the holy ba garment or the pala garment the garments of your queenship go to the netherworld 
After you remove the holy crown the ornament of glorification upon your head in order to descend to the netherworld 
You should not equipperfect your face with allure 
You should unfasten the small uridim dogs atfrom your feet descend to the netherworld 
 you go down  does not  
They released holy Inanna they  her 
Inanna herself handed over Dumuzi 
As for the youth we will put his feet in the great beam 
As for the youth we will cast the esad traprestraint upon him we will place neck in the neckstock 
The ubri spear kibir weapon and the great ukur spear were raised before him 
They were sharpening large hazin axes 
They were to cover his own face with his own garment 
The youth raised his hands heavenwards for Utu 
Utu I am your comrade like you I am a youth 
The one who married your sister 
She descends to the netherworld 
Utu you are the judge of justice you are never to oppress anyone 
After you have altered my hands and changed my form 
I shall elude the hand of my pursuing galla demons they must not grasp me 
As a sagkal snake I shall traverse the meadows and the mountain range 
I shall take refuge with my sister Gtinanna 
He altered his hands and changed his form 
As a sagkal snake he traversed the meadows and the mountain range 
Dumuzi like a bird flying from the claws of a falcon guarded for his very life 
He took refuge with Getinanna 
She scratched her cheeks she scratched her nose 
She unleashed a spearthorn in her side she split apart her garment 
She was intoning a lament of anathema for the youth afflicted by anathema 
Alas my brother the shepherd Amauumgalana the days of the youth do not  
Alas my brother the youth whose mother did not release her goodness 
The galla demons were seeking out Dumuzi they were roaming around 
They were galla demons without compassion who did not have a father mother spouse brother sister or son 
 removed from  the one set apart from the universe 
You are gala demons those who are to be reglected   
They did not have the power of goodness they did not know good and evil 
Who has seen someone with a healthy life without a home and all alone 
I will not go to where the friend is I will not go to where the inlaw is 
We shall go for the shepherd where getinanna is 
The lament was not yet finished in her mouth 
When the galla demons came to where getinanna was 
One of them was saying Show where your brother is but she was saying not a word to him 
He made her shave her own hair in her crotch but she was not saying a word to him 
He made her own hands shred her garment but she was not saying a word to him 
He did not find Dumuzi in the house of Getinanna 
The junior galla demons were speaking to the eldest demons 
Come let us go to the pure sheepfold 
They were searching they were  
they were seeking he was seen 
They carved him with giriura knife they smote him in a silent place 
The sister roamed around in the city like a bird 
Lady who bears an aura amongst the furious me who rides the great me 
Inanna equipped with the  aankar weapon cloaking the battlefield with its bloodterror 
Who leans the shield upon the ground like one who runs amid the great battles 
Who clutches the storm and the stormwind 
For great lady Inanna counsel is dispensed in battle wise one 
Destroyer of the mountain she unleashed the arrow towards  by means of her power who smote with the arm in the mountain 
She screamed in the universe like a pirig creature and made the people tremble 
Like a great wild bull she stands wildly in the hostile land 
My lady as you grow like heaven 
Young woman Inanna as you are supreme like the earth 
As you come out like Utu the king as you move widely about 
As you move inare suitable for heaven as you bear a furious aura 
As you carry the brilliant sunlight on the earth 
One who goes in the mountain range as you bring out a lapis net 
As you bathe in the pureflowering mountain 
As you fashion the uba mountain the mountain the pure place 
As your wear the udugita mace like the ancestral deities Enar and Enul 
As you make heads roll in its battles like you were using a  weapon 
The blackheaded shout this with song 
In all the lands the blackheaded sing this ilulama song sweetly 
The lady of battle the greateldest child of Suen 
Young woman Inanna I want to praise you 
Inanna said I am the lady when I go around heaven when I go around earth 
I am Inanna when I go around heaven when I go around earth 
When I go around the earth namely Elam and Subir 
When I go around the earth namely the land of lulubi 
When I am to thrash around in the inner mountain 
I am Inanna I am the one that had approached the mountain it should notindeed it did act fearfully towards me 
Like one who should notindeed did drag its beard in the dust for me 
The mountain should wish for my way 
She was dressed in the pala garment she clad herself in pleasureallurestarsrosettes 
She adorned her forehead with a redfurious aura 
She arranged the red carnelian beads on her pure throat 
She acted youthfully with the sevenheaded udugita weapon at her right 
She set her foot on the staircase of lapis 
In the evening  brought out  
She set the door that is to be marveled at open in its path 
She established the nesag offerings for An and established the siskur ritesofferings for him 
He accepted the offerings and sat in his place 
Heshe filled the seat of honor of Anheaven 
An my father I make a case to you put your ear to my words 
An imposed my aurafear of me in the heavens 
In the outskirts of heaven there is a silig axe 
There is a sign and a mansium royal symbol 
To flatten the platform to make firm the thrones foundation 
To set in place the arm of weaponry to bend  like a mubum tree 
To yoke a team of six and hold the position 
To smite a caravan to go to the border in an expedition 
If you inspirelit establish an aura your idiocy 
If your dishonesty  
You do not approach the house 
If your idiocy  you increaseIf my idiocy  is diminished 
It is a fact that you are experiencing pleasure alas it is a fact that you should stand   
After you have relaxed  I shall arise  
Servile female worker of the district the pusher of the children of man 
If my friend dropped his head in the plants then no one can know his place 
If he dropped his head in the tiny plants then no one can know his place 
Dumuzi They were seeking his head in the tiny plants no one found him 
Dumuzi They were seeking his head in the large plants no one found him 
Dumuzi wept and made sobbing noises 
My sister sustained me in the city my friend killed me in the city 
May my sister station her son in the street and may he be kissed 
May my friend station his son in the street and may he not be kissed 
They were braiding a cord for him they were knotting a net for him 
They were scratching sticks of manu wood for him 
The man before him was pelting him 
The man behind him was pulling him out from his hiding place as if he was merely one cubit tall 
his arms were bound in manacles 
The young man raised his hands heavenward for Utu 
Utu you are my brother in law I am your inlaw 
I am the one who made a betrothal gift in Uruk 
I am the one who kissed the holy lips 
I am the one who played on the holy knees the knees of Inanna 
After you have prepared my hands as the hands of a gazelle 
I want to run for my life towards  
Utu accepted his tears as a kadra gift 
Like a compassionate person he  mercy 
After he prepared his hands as the hands of a gazelle 
After he prepared his feet as the feet of a gazelle 
He ran for his life towards  
Come let us go to  
Dumuzi They seized him at  
They encircled the man and  the reservoir 
They were braiding a cord for him they were knotting a net for him 
They were braiding the zippatum cord for him 
They were scratching sticks of manu wood for him 
his arms were bound in manacles 
The young man raised his hands heavenward for Utu 
Utu you are my brother in law I am your inlaw 
You are my food carrier to the Eanna temple 
I am the one who made a betrothal gift in Uruk 
He slipped away from the demons 
After water is poured if only water could be drunk 
After flour is poured if only water could be drunk 
After water was poured after flour was poured she sat him down there 
The old woman left the house 
when the old woman left 
The galla demons saw her 
If the old woman does not know where Dumuzi dwells 
What makes her look around with a frightened gaze 
What makes her shout with a frightened voice 
Come We will go to the house of old woman Belili

He gave to him life force in the palace 
I want to go back to Ur 
My king on your throne the one of Enlil 
NannaSuen May he be born in a span of seven days 
Lord Dilimbabbar May he be born in a span of seven days 
The lord paid attention to the mountain that sustains man 
Lord Gilgamesh paid attention to the mountain that sustains man 
Enkidu the shoulder of a young man has not brought out the limitssecrets of living 
I want to enter into the mountain I want to establish my name 
Where a name can stand be inscribed I want to establish my name 
Where a name cannot stand be inscribed I want to establish the name of the gods 
His servant Enkidu was replying 
My king if you are to enter the mountain Utu should know of it along with us 
Utu the youth Utu should know of it along with us 
The decision of the mountain of cut juniper belongs to the youth Utu Utu should know of it along with us 
Gilgamesh took a white goat kid 
He clasped a brown goat kid of the madaria delivery to his chest 
His hand held the pure scepter at his nose 
Utu if I am to enter into the mountain will you be my helper 
If I am to enter into the mountain of cut juniper will you be my helper 
Utu from heaven was replying to him 
I shall greet you may my words be listened to 
In my city a man dies and I am distressed 
One has forgotten a man and my heart is pained 
I saw a corpse floated by the river in the water 
A tall man has never stretched to heaven 
A broad man has never engulfed the land 
I want to enter into the mountain I want to establish my name 
The 5th is  a screaming sagkal snake  splitting the mountain range 
The 6th is  beating its breast against the mountain like a flood 
They will bring the boats for portage to the base of the mountain range 
It was made pleasing there for the one who cuts the juniper 
It was made pleasing there for lord Gilgamesh 
In his city as a single man he sounded the horn 
As two companions he and Enkidu they shouted together 
The one who has a household to his household the one who has lives with a mother to his mother 
May single males acting like me act on behalf of my power 
The one who has a household to his household the one who has lives with a mother to his mother 
The single males acting like me fifty of them have acted on behalf of my power 
He set out to the house of the blacksmith 
He was pouring the metal for the blade of the aagar ax the agasilig axe the arms of heroism 
He set out to the grove of deep shade 
He was striking down the axe handle of halub wood apple wood and boxwood 
No one can cut a threeply rope 
When it sank when it sank 
When the Magan boat sank 
When the barge Magilum sank 
A raft a lifeboat seized  
Come let us go and have a look 
But if we go 
There will be an aura there will be an aura turn back 
There will be cunning there will be cunning turn back 
This is your thought but come lets go 
After someone has not even approached within 36 ninda 
Huwawa has already seized him in his house of junipercedar 
He has looked it is the look of death 
You who are a young man to your detriment you will not return to the city of your mother 
He imposed his aura into his muscles and his feet 
He could not turn his foot ie take a step on the ground 
Huwawa by means of his own strength  he said to him sit 
The hero sat down wept and made sobbing noises 
Huwawa sat down wept and made sobbing noises 
Huwawa  compassion for Gilgamesh 
Gilgamesh release me 
So that I may speak a word with Utu 
Gilgamesh swore an oath by heaven he swore an oath by earth he swore an oath by the netherworld 
He seized his hand saying you shall not be deprived 
At that time Gilgamesh the native had compassion in his heart 
Gilgamesh was speaking to Enkidu 
Enkidu may the captured bird go back to its place for me 
The tall if he lacks intellect 
The Namtar demonfate will consume him the Namtar demonfate having not been revealed 
The caught bird that is to go back to its place 
The caught youth that is to be returned to the lap of its mother 
You will not return to the city of your birth mother 
Huwawa was speaking to Enkidu 
Huwawa was speaking to Enkidu 
He set out to the blacksmith shop

The one who brought out his terror 
The one who brought out his terror 
Those distant days those distant remote days 
Those distant nights those distant remote nights 
At that time when a primeval entity was made manifest 
At that ancient time when a primeval entity was cared for 
When bread was tasted lit covered in the shrines of the land 
When heaven had been separated from earth 
When earth had been separated from heaven 
When  established the name of humanity on  
When An had brought away the sky 
When Enlil had brought away the earth 
When he rode when he rode 
For the king  cast down the small stones 
For Enki  cast down the large stones 
The little ones were hammerstoneshandsized stones 
The large ones were stones that made the reeds shake 
It was the keel of the little boat of Enki 
The bobbing turtle was overwhelmed 
For the king the water of the prow 
For Enki the water of the stern 
Was slaughtering like a lion 
At that time there was a single tree a halub tree 
The one that was planted on the bank of the Euphrates 
The Euphrates struck it with floodwater 
Fearing the command of Enlil was coming by 
She grasped the tree in her hand and brought it to Uruk 
She was bringing it towards the flowering orchard of Inanna 
The woman did not plant the tree as it was in her hand it was by means of her foot that she planted it 
The woman did not water the tree as it was in her hand it was by means of her foot that she watered it 
She said When am I to sit on its flowering throne 
She said When am I to I lie down on its flowering bed 
At its base a snake that was immune to incantations made a nest 
In its branches the Anzu bird placed its chick 
The demon maiden of the empty wind made a house in its middle 
The laughing rejoicing young woman 
Holy Inanna how she was weeping 
The day was about to break the horizon was about to light up 
When Utu came out from his chamber 
Holy Inanna was speaking 
My brother long ago when fate was decreed 
When An had brought away the sky 
When Enlil had brought away the earth 
When  gifted that of the netherworld on behalf of ErekigalWhen that of the netherworld was gifted on behalf of Erekigal 
When he rode when he rode 
When the father rode towards the netherworld 
When Enki rode towards the netherworld 
For the lord  cast down the small stones 
For Enki  cast down the large stones 
The little ones were hammerstoneshandsized stones 
The ibbaru harness there was fifty mina within it  on his hips 
He tied on the fifty mina 
of his hazin axe the weapon of his campaign 
which weighed 7 talents and 7 mina he took hold 
At the base of the halub tree he smote the snake that was immune to incantations 
In its branches the Anzu bird took its chick and dragged it away to the mountain range 
The demon maidens of the empty wind who had built a house in its middle
fled to the wasteland 
He struck the tree at its trunk and cut its branches 
The citizens of his city who had come to him 
made it submitgathered the branches 
They gave it to his sister holy Inanna as her throne 
He took the base of the tree for his ballHow the base of the tree was taken for his ball 
The one who always boasted about himself brings out the ball in the smoothed street the young men of his city who always played ball 
Because of him the one by whom the force of widows children was ridden 
They lamented with the phrase oh my neck oh my hips 
Away fromby means of the accusation of the widows 
He dropped his ball and my mallet into the bottom of the netherworld 
He brought his hand up to it and could not touch it 
Did you see the man who Ikur trampled with a storm I saw him How is he treated 
He  like an ox eaten by parasites 
Did you see the man who fell in battle I saw him How is he treated 
His food is set aside his water is set aside eating  food and  water 
He is living in the city of his god 
He does not cease screaming Alas my selfwind ie breath Alas my limbs 
Did you see the man who was overtaken by the curse of his mother and father I saw him How is he treated 
His heir has absconded his ghost roams around 
Did you see the man who disregarded the oath of his god I saw him How is he treated 
His ghost eats bitter food and drinks bitterbrackish water 
Did you see the ghost that does not have someone to place food for him I saw him How is he treated 
He eats scrapings of the bowl bread crumbs  that have fallen into the street 
Did you see the tiny stillborn babies who do not know their own name I saw them How are they treated 
They play in a troughbucket of gold and silver filled with honey and ghee 
Did you see the man who was set on fire I did not see him 
His smoke has risen into heaven his ghost is not held on the groundin the netherworld 
Did you see the man who deceives the god by having sworn an oath 
At the libation place for the dead at the top of the netherworld  he drinks with perpetual thirstthirst consumes him 
Did you see the citizen of girsu the  of his father and mother

But he will not give it to you saying that which is before it is used up

May your raging divine weapon strike the evil person with lightning like the plague god Erra 
Lady at the place of clashing of weapons and planting of standards no one can get away from the opening of your arms 
My daughter wherever it is pleasing to you to extend upwards to extend downwards to pull taut or to loosen 
At festivals offerings banquets prostration making obeisance and invoking the name of the god 
as long as he does not seek out the place of reconciliation with your divinity no god will be agreeable to his petition

from where he stands destroying for him the foreign lands 
He of rightful speech whose utterances are firmly established 
When he arrived at the Ebabbar the house of Utu 
To those who did not return and spread out the days were not long 
The hero avenged his city 
The gods of their cities he caused to get into shoes 
their thick and tall trees with the axe he brought to destruction 
their trees of wealth he crossed over at the crown 
their small trees he uprooted 
In their wellorchards where date syrup and fig trees grew he made weeds grow 
 plants and  herbs continually break through the earth 
After the king had destroyed the cities and laid flat the city walls

thesesons of Enegir and sons of Ur 
with the lord their  oars hung out 
At the temples of Nippur the temples Duranki 
at the Kargetina of Enlil 
did he not moor the boat 
With the silver and lapis lazuli of the foreign lands put into leather pouches 
all their treasures gathered together 
with all the goods of the foreign lands counted to one load 
a destiny for ulgi he decrees 
King a destiny for you I shall decree a good destiny for you I shall decree 
heroism as your destiny I shall decree 
In terrifying splendor may you lean your neck 
Before your fierce face may no one stand 
May your crown of royalty shine radiantly 
May your sceptre be a thing of princes 
and may its shining branches provide you with shade 
May you be a breathoflife king in your assembly 
May your life flourish like herbs may it flourish like grain 
May it flourish like a right mes tree in a broad plot 
For Ningirsu 
of Enlil 
Gudea 
ruler  
of Laga 
made a fitting thing resplendent for him namely  
and restored for him 
At the king sailing 
to Uruk towards the princely divine powers 
Did he not he moor the boat at the quay of Kulaba 
With a big wild bull of the mountains with uplifted horns 
with a reddish kid and a bearded kid doubled up on the breast 
before Inanna in the shrine of Eanna he enters 
Good shepherd ulgi loving heart dressed himself in a ma garment 
put a ili wig as a crown on his head 
and spontaneously struck up a song 
singing the lyrics 
When for the king for the lord 
I have bathed 
when for the shepherd Dumuzi I have bathed 
when I have adorned my sides with clay 
when with resin I have colored my nose 
when with kohl I have covered my face 
when with hands of his fairness 
when the lord who lies down beside silver Inanna 
the shepherd Dumuzi 
has said I would loosen that of the lap 
 had touched 
when my lapwool has  
my pawool he has played 
when he has put hand to my vulva 
when on my sweet stomach he has lain 
like his night boat  
then the lord I shall caress 
the good shepherd ulgi I shall caress 
decree him a good destiny 
his thick arms I shall caress 
shepherdship of all lands 
as his destiny I shall decree 
The lady the mountaincrystal of heaven 
delight of the blackheaded 
by her father granted divine powers 
Inanna daughter of Suen 
decrees a destiny 
Your weapon carrier in combat like an attendant am I 
Your advocate in the assembly am I 
Shepherd chosen by  silver are you 
King good provider of Eanna are you 
carneol of Ans Irigal are you 
fir for running 
fit to lift head in the august dais are you 
fit to take a seat on the lapis throne

fit to lift to the side the mitumweapon 
fit to open knees with mace 
fit to send off straight the broad arrows 
fit for throwing stick and shield bound to the hips 
as to your hands fit for silver staff 
as to your feet fit for silver sandals 
fit for playing like a calf of lapis on my silver breast 
May your loving stomach be lasting 
An has doned this for you may he never alter it 
So did Inanna caress him 
He who knows the joyful heart of Ninegal 
bathed a white kid 
house of the august breeding bull roars 
up to the young man Utu raising his radiant forehead 
King colorful words sweet face 
mighty hero born to be a lion 
whose feet trample great mountains 
the heroes of the foreign lands you have brought down 
you have trampled upon all the thrones 
your name to the edge of heaven you have established 
And so at Enegir city built in splendor 
did he not moor the boat 
Seed placed by the prince in the silver womb born on the bright mountain 
 like date syrup ghee  
 like date syrup ghee

 like date syrup ghee  
King the lord of prayers and supplications chooses you by heart 
shepherd ulgi the lord of prayers and supplications chooses you by heart 
Who sets a king given strength by Enlil 
Who exits to your  
Having desired  battle with you 
When like the thunder bird you shriek who stands before you 
When like the storm you howl 
the foreign lands open reeds ablaze mountains trembling like reeds 
in the houses of the foreign lands watching 
Tidnum well marveled 
Like Utu your terror radiates in battle 
Like Nergal your mace drools in death 
your lance reaches into the blood of the Land 
The great door of the city are you the great wall of the Land are you 
May your  call in abundance 
May the loving heart Inanna never abandon you 
After Ninazu had called  blessings again and again 
he let ewes goodly produce endless lambs 
let jennies goodly produce endless kids 
let white cows set up calves 
then before Nanna in his Etemenniguru he enters with them 
head held high in the most fitting house of the the royal household in its royal offering place the silver place 
His king Aimbabbar casts a joyous glance at him 
for ulgi the good shepherd of Sumer decreed a fate 
Hero lord mighty one of the foreign lands right arm of the Land 
you have achieved victory for me have carried out the commandeds 
The houses of the rebel lands that I have cursed you have reduced to ruin mounds 
May you never grow weary of perfecting the divine powers for me every month at new moon 
Like Anan may your name be as sweet in the mouth of the Land and in the mouths of all the countries 
Thus did Suen decree a good fate 
In the Egalma of Ninegal he took his seat on the silver throne 
The Itaran of Sumer omniscient from the womb 
lets no strong man wrong the weak 
lets child answer truthfully to his father 
Sumer is filled with abundance 
Ur prolonged in splendor 
 establishes 
Because the king exulted in his triumph and let his might radiate 
his heroism set well 
made the rebellious lands bow 
made our city Ur raise neck in prosperity 
king adorned with a face of colorful lapis son of Enlil 
lifting up head to heaven in broad crown 
manth and passing days making the Land of Sumer and all the foreign lands play joyously

She had the tablet of the stars on her lap 
She counseled it

his quiver depicting lions and lionesses against which fierce snakes
all of them arms of battle that have been endued with the power of kingship
with all this the ruler who had built the House
is presenting the House
huge copper pails huge copper urivessels
shining copper edavessels shining copper bowls befitting An
so that a properly set table  altar
might be piled up to An
Ningirsu his city
In its bedroom the resting place of the House
he set up the bed
Everybody with Enlils son like the birds in their 
now rests
That from now on the river be full of flowing water
that there be carp and perch in the marshes
that the inspector of fisheries and the dike inspector might assist
that barley might be filled in and shipped on the great waters
that tons heaps and tons the income of the land of Laga
might be piled up
that lambs might abound around the healthy ewes
that the rams be let loose on the healthy ewes
that many calves might stand by the healthy cows
that the oxen be properly yoked
and the farmer and the oxdriver might stand at their place
and that the hirelings who feed them follow behind them
 that huge copper  be strapped on the jackasses
that the mill might burst with work
that  be set right
that  be set right
that the courtyard of Eninnu be filled with joy
that together with the kettle drums ala instruments and harps might sound in perfect concert
and that Ningirsus beloved harp the DragonoftheLand
to that intent did the ruler who had built the Eninnu
did come
The House lifted the head proud of itself
unparalleled in awe and splendor
Like a boat it 
The canopy of the dais resting on a support
The poles of the canopy and their caps
are Ningirsu himself laden with terror
The leather cord of the canopy fitted in front of it
In his most fascinating blue chariot
The owner of the House the warrior Ningirsu stands like the sun god
The bed of the House standing in the bedroom
is adorned with young cows that kneel down at their shed
On the snowwhite cover of the bed having a pattern of blue flowers
mother Baba with the lord Ningirsu
is lying at ease
Large bronze plates offer all sorts of food
in the good house at the side meals prepared from first 
are like huge stout troughs with an inexhaustible supply of water
and the goblets standing next to them
are both the Tigris and the Euphrates
bringing abundance
Thus he had caused everything to function as it should in his city
Gudea had built the Eninnu
He brought fat and cream into the dairy
he stored many things in the  of the House
He had debts remitted and he granted pardons
When his master had entered his House
for seven days
the slave was allowed to walk side by side with his master
he had words cut off the evilspeaking tongue
and he had anything disharmonious turned away from the House
To the justice ordained by Nane and Ningirsu
he paid attention
nor did he expose the widow to the influential one
a daughter of it would become its heir
Days of justice had risen for him
and he set his foot on the neck of evil and complaint
For his city like the sun god
had he himself not risen from the horizon
He 
In the face of bright heaven
he showed who he was
he had unblemished oxen and kids slaughtered
He put a jar in the open
and poured much wine into it
The harp DragonoftheLand he joined with the kettle drum
and the ala instruments sounded for him like a storm
Lo the ruler on a 
Gudea 
 brought forth abundance for him
All places grew speckled barley for him
Gudea served a delicious banquet to the lord Ningirsu
He seated An at the place of honour for him
he made Enlil sit next to An
and next to Enlil
he seated Ninma
The owner rejoiced over the House
The owner rejoiced over the House
and he made a firm promise for the brick of Eninnu
O brick of Eninnu
let something favorable be promised
brick of Eninnu let it be promised
let something favorable be promised
House a mountain founded in heaven
built as your very self
He determines the destiny of the brickwork of the Eninnu
he determines the brickworks destiny
The temple that lets fear fall like embers set upon the earth and embracing heaven
 Let the cattle pens be built on your behalf
 Let the cattle pens be built on your behalf
let the sheepfolds be renewed on your account
May the people lie down in safe pastures under your reign enjoying abundance
and let the eyes of all the countries be directed toward Sumer
May the House your Thunderbird soar in the skies for your benefit
grown as tall as Gilgamesh
grown as tall as Gilgamesh
grown as tall as Gilgamesh
its throne set there no one shall remove
your mother goddess is Ninsuna the mother who bore healthy offspring
and who loves her offspring
You are the young whom the dear cow has born
the faithful youth arisen from Laga
you are Ningirsus
May your name be famous from Below to Above
O Gudea what you ordered
nobody  shall pass over
you  are a man known to An
you are a faithful ruler to whose house a firm promise has been made
Gudea son of Ningezida
may life be prolonged for you
O House that reaches to heaven like a great mountain
whose awe and aura are shed over the Land
now that An that Enlil have made a firm promise for Laga
that about Ningirsus reputation
all countries have learned
that Eninnu is joined both to heaven and earth
praise be unto Ningirsu
Of the composition Ningirsus House having been built
Gudea 
ruler 
of Lagash 
of Ningirsu 
was built 
For Ninhursaga 
the lady who grew up with the city 
his lady 
Gudea 
ruler 
her temple of the city Girsu 
Her sacred treasure chest 
he constructed for her 
Her great throne of queenship 
he constructed for her 
and into her Great Temple he had it brought to her 
From the mountains of Magan 
he had diorite brought down 
he formed it 
The lady who would determine the fates in heaven and earth 
Nintu 
the mother of the gods 
of Gudea 
his life she shall prolong 
he named it for her 
and into the temple he had it brought to her 
Within the temple of Ningirsu 
his master
for the statue of Gudea 
the ruler 
of Lagash 
the man by whom the Eninnu temple 
one sila3 of bread 
one half sila3 of heapingflour 
and one half sila3 of emmer groats 
being the regular offering existing for it 
a future ruler 
who shall revoke it

shall thereby diminish

he with a shriveled penis 
and the woman who had been in labor 
he sent out of the city 
Women did not carry the earth baskets for it 
like the city Eridu 
in a clean place he built 
There was no beating with whips 
nor beating with leather straps 
No mother hit her child with anything 
The military governors 
overseers 
those who performed worker levies 
while stationed at the work 
as light as wool under the carding comb 
No pickax was used in the cemetery of the city 
no corpse was buried 
The lamentation singer did not play the harp or bring forth laments 
of Lagash 
a person having a lawsuit 
to the place of oathtaking 
did not make another person go 
and a creditor 
did not enter another persons house 
For Ningirsu 
his master 
he Gudea made a fitting thing come forth resplendently 
namely his temple Eninnu with a white thunderbird 
he built for him 
In the center of it his beloved high terrace 
with aromatic cedar 
When the temple of Ningirsu 
Ningirsu 
from the Upper Sea 
to the Lower Sea 
opened up the roads for him 
From the Amanus the mountain range of cedar 
cedars 
whose length was sixty cubits

and boxwood

he made into planks 
and brought them down from their mountains

and in the courtyard of the Eninnu 
he erected them for him 
From Tidanum

alabaster in blocks 
he brought in 
and into destroying lions 
and as gate bolts 
he mounted them in the temple 
In Abullat 
he mined copper 
and into the Mace Which the World Quarters Cannot Bear 
he fashioned it for him 
From the land of Meluhha 
he brought down ebony 
and erected it for him 
and into a mace with three lion heads 
Gold in its ore 
from the mountain range of Hahum 
he brought down

from the land of Meluhha 
he brought down 
and into a quiver 
he fashioned it for him

he brought down 
and into the bird named Levels the Multitudes 
he fashioned it

he brought down 
and in the platform of the Eninnu 
he used it for construction 
Haumclay 
From the mountain range of Barme 
many stones 
into big boats 
he loaded 
and he placed them around the base of the Eninnu 
The cities of Anan and Elam with weapons 
he smote 
and the booty from them 
to Ningirsu 
into the Eninnu 
he had brought in 
Gudea 
the ruler 
when the Eninnu 
he had built for Ningirsu 
he made it as a lasting treasure 
A temple fashioned like this 
not a single ruler 
for Ningirsu 
had ever built 
But he Gudea did indeed build it 
To the commands 
of Ningirsu 
he set forth a faithful hand 
From the land of Magan 
he brought down diorite 
and into this stone figure 
he formed it 
For my master 
his temple 
I built 
so life is my reward 
was how he named it for him 
and into the Eninnu 
he had it brought to him 
Gudea 
to the statue 
Statue to my master 
do say thus 
his beloved temple 
I had debts remitted and I washed all hands 
For seven days no barley was ground 
The slave woman was made equal with her mistress 
his master stood side by side 
In my city the sexually impure with respect to him Ningirsu 
Evil to its house 
I made go back 
and Ningirsu 
An orphan I did not let be put under the control of a rich person 
a daughter of it its heir 
I made become

his own god 
Ningirsu 
my master 
has called to from among all the people 
who then my judgments 
shall overturn

and may there be famine during his reign

from Kish to Gilgamesh in Uruk came 
There are wells to be finished wells of the Land yet to be finished 
there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished 
there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed 
To the house of Kish We should not submit Should we not smite it with weapons 
In the convened assembly the elders of his city 
answer Gilgamesh 
There are indeed wells to be finished wells of the Land yet to be finished 
So we should submit to the house of Kish We should not smite it with weapons 
in Inanna placing his trust 
the advice of the elders of his city did not take seriously 
there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished 
there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed 
Never before have you submitted to the house of Kish Should you not smite it with weapons 
In the convened assembly the ablebodied men of his city answer Gilgamesh 
Standing on duty and sitting in attendance 
the reins of the donkey always grasping 
To the house of Kish you all should not submit With weapons should we not smite it 
the great gods created 
The great wall the wall which An founded 
you watch over You are its king and warrior 
When Aga comes what terror he will experience 
Its men will be incapable of confronting us 
Then Gilgamesh the lord of Kulaba 
at the advice of the ablebodied men of his city rejoiced and his spirit brightened 
His servant Enkidu he addressed 
On this account let the weaponry and arms of battle be made ready 
Let the battle mace to your side return 
A great terror and radiance may they create 
When he comes my great fearsomeness will overwhelm him 
His reasoning will become confused his judgment disarrayed 
Not 5 days not 1 days had passed 
when Aga the son of Enmebaragesi to Uruk with his men laid siege  
Uruks reasoning became confused 
Gilgamesh the lord of Kulaba 
to its warriors speaks 
My warriors shall have the choice 
Let someone with courage rise up I shall go against Aga 
in admiration to his king says 
I shall go against Aga 
so that his reasoning will become confused his judgment disarrayed 
Birurtura through the city gate went out 
at the gate of the city gate they captured him 
Into the presence of Aga he came 
speaking to Aga 
Aga trained his eyes 
Slave is that man your king 
Were that man my king 
were that his angry brow 
were those his bison eyes 
were that his lapis lazuli beard 
were those his elegant fingers 
would he not cast down multitudes Would he not raise up multitudes 
Would not the canalmouths of the land be filled with silt 
Would he not take captive Aga the king of Kish in the midst of his army 
Hitting him striking him 
Birurturas entire length they were beating 
After the mirrorholder of Uruk Gilgamesh climbs up on the wall 
the young and old of Kulaba his radiance overwhelms 
The ablebodied men of Uruk with battle maces he armed 
Enkidu through the city gate alone went out 
Gilgamesh out over the wall leaned 
Looking up Aga opened his eyes 
Slave is that man your king 
It was just as he had said 
Multitudes fell multitudes rose up 
multitudes with dust were smeared 
all the nations were overwhelmed 
Aga the king of Kish in the midst of his army he took captive 
Gilgamesh the lord of Kulaba 
to Aga speaks 
Aga my foreman Aga my lieutenant 
Aga my commander of the troops 
Aga gave me breath Aga gave me life 
Aga a fugitive into his embrace took 
Uruk the handiwork of the gods 
the majestic residence which An established 
you watch over You are its king and warrior 
an exuberant person a prince beloved of An 
Before Utu your former kindness is hereby repaid to you 
Aga to Kish he set free 
your praise is sweet

Having departed from BaraIlitappe

he made an offering
and prayed to him
may you be my ally
and north of Adab
when Utu had risen
he went
and prayed to him saying
O Utu Gutium
Enlil has given to me
At that place just beyond Gutium
he laid a trap for him
and the troops he drove to him
their generals Whereupon Tirigan
king of Gutium
fled all alone from there
The place where to save his life
he had fled
because he a king to whom Enlil had given power
he was they had realized
Tirigan
they did not let go
By the envoys of Utuegal
Tirigan
They placed fetters on his hands
and put a cloth blindfold over his eyes
Utuegal before Utu
and on his neck he set his foot
Gutium the fanged snake of the mountain ranges
he made drink from the cracks in the earth
he made an offering

such for one day they received   
In order to establish my name for eternity 
I sank the holy foundation pegs

a silver standing statue of the father who begot him  
NurAdad 
the king of Larsa 
with beautiful features
set with inscriptions 
he fashioned for him
he dedicated to him 
In the main courtyard of the shrine Ebabbar 
the most wonderous place of the nation 
in his exalted temple for offerings  
most suitable
he stood it up 
the mighty man 
king of Larsa 
king of Sumer and Akkad 
the king who the Ebabbar the temple of Utu 
did build 
and who the divine plans of the temples of the gods 
did restore 
when An Enlil Nanna and Utu 
a favorable reign of justice 
whose days have been prolonged 
by means of my broad wisdom 
greatly established  
and preeminent  
for my cities and land 
as well as the course and praise
today and afterwards 
to make highly resplendent 
to An and Enlil 
I made pleasing words 
and they to my righteous prayers  
having been agreeable 
for the digging of the Tigris 
also through long days of life
to establish my name 
with their unalterable words
At that time by the commands 
of An and Inanna 
and of Ikur my personal god
my helper 
the Tigris 
Utus river of abundance 
by means of my triumph 
I dug there in a grand fashion 
I brought its beginning 
and into a marsh 
I directed it in a great fashion 
Thus a constant water supply 
I established
When the Tigris the great river 
I dug 
the wages for one man were 
1 kor barley each 
2 sila bread each 
4 sila beer each 
and 2 shekels oil each 
in one day 
thusly they received it
Either a man less wages 
or a man more wages 
I did not let him take
Through the strength of the land 
By means of the commands and divine decisions 
of the great gods 
I returned to its former place
and so for all future time 
I have indeed made my name stand forth 
For Utu 
Siniddinam 
the mighty man 
provider of Ur 
king of Larsa 
and king of Sumer and Akkad 
the Ebabbar 
his beloved temple
for his life 
he built for him 
The divine attributes and divine plans 
of the office of en priest 
for all future days 
Siniddinam 
in order to  
to Utu my master 
and to the prayers of my hearts desire
he was agreeable
At that time through the willingness 
of my master 
I built for him 
Like a lifted up mountain range 
I raised up its top for him 
and in his residence which pleases the heart 
I let Utu dwell
For Utu 
lord and judge of heaven and earth 
learned in decision 
who chooses the right 
the king of the Ebabbar temple 
Siniddinam 
the shepherd who provides everything in abundance  
for Nippur 
the provider of Ur 
king of Larsa 
the Ebabbar 
his beloved temple 
for his life 
he built for him 
For that which was done   
may Utu 
rejoice over him  
and a good life 
whose days will be made great 
fate did determine 
to perfect the divine attributes and plans 
to enlarge its residence
 he having spoken 
then it was towards me Siniddinam 
the mighty man 
the provider of Ur 
that youthful Utu out of all the lands 
To the shepherdship of Larsa 
he raised me up 
its troops of numerous areas 
at my command he made dwell 
and all the great orders for them 
he put fully into my hands 
His residence which gladdens his heart 
to enlarge widely 
in view of my reverence 
regarding it he gave me orders  
At that time Utu my master 
through my pleasing words of prayer 
any cause for complaint from my city  
I having made dwell together as one  
wages food ointment 
enough to please the heart 
I baked there 
like a mountain range on a pure place 
its exalted high terrace
I built for him 
When the Ebabbar shrine itself 
I had built 
The wages per person were 
 kor of barley each 
2 sila of dates each 
2 sila of cheese each 
2 sila of sesame bran each 
2 shekels of oil each 
in one day
thus one received 
In the days of my excellent reign 
which Utu my master 
gave to me 
4 kor barely 
12 kur dates 
15 minas of wool 
3 ban oil 
5 ban of lard 
at the market rate in Ur 
Larsa and in my land
Siniddinam the great prince  
who carried off the lower lands 
at that time with a shining countenance 
which gladdens the heart of my city 
on the shrine Ebabbar 
its work I did finish  
and so the hearts of Utu 
and his consort erda
For Utu 
the lord the big lion 
who opens the bolt of heaven 
king of the Ebabbar 
his master 
the mighty man 
son of Gaerabi 
king of Larsa 
and king of Sumer and Akkad 
the Ebabbar temple 
his shrine of delight 
The dwelling the place founded for all future time 
he built for him
Over the one making pleasing words steadfastly   
may Utu rejoice 
and may he  
Of his beautiful life 
its days may he extend
of the shrine Ebabbar

the king of the gods
the great lord of all the lands
towards Utu his gracious eyes
its wall to build
the Ebabbar temple
its top to raise as high as the sky
and Utu and his consort erda
into their sacred residence
to introduce amidst very happy rejoicing
with his word which cannot be altered
he spoke to him 
for the hero youthful Utu
a great destiny that by Enlil
regarding Sippar and the Ebabbar temple
had been decreed
To me Samsuiluna
the king created by him
he spoke happily
and he issued to me the order for it
At that time
all of Sumer and Akkad
whose people had become hostile to me
eight times
The various cities of my enemies
I turned into mounds and ruins
The enemies
and evildoers
I made dwell under my command
From the time long ago
when the brickwork of the Ebabbar temple
and so the wall of Sippar
he had not built
But I Samsuiluna
one loved by Utu
the mighty king
king of the four world quarters
the king whose utterances
with Utu
and erda have found favor
at the commands of Utu
and Marduk
its bricks for it I had formed
and the wall of Sippar
I raised up like a great mountain
I renovated the Ebabbar
their exalted high terrace of the ziggurrat
I raised up its top like the sky
and Utu Ikur
and erda
into their sacred residence
amidst very happy rejoicing
I introduced
To the Ebabbar
I returned its favorable guardian genius
and that commanded by Utu
and Marduk
Of that wall Utu
to Samsuiluna

A person who the order of an evil thing

O Enlil with exalted utterances your judgments being high and wide 
ImeDagan the strong young man with the muscles and body of a lion strong youth possessing fearsomeness 
who alone is exalted lord whose called good name is demonstrated in all lands 
under his sway he has made the living creatures numerous 
and into whose hand were given the Black Headed People in their shelters where the people reside 
They are not merely left to him in his good palace 
At that time ImeDagan the youth the hero of the runners 
to Nippur being the city where the seed of the myriad people sprang up where the living were born 
who daily brings everything needed made a great resolution 
When he rises up it is gigantic a flood bringing a wind in its fury 
like a fierce lion of the steppe going with strength and youthfulness 
opening wide his knees on the highway striding towards battle and combat 
like a horse  on the highway with its tail extended 
like a buck when racing around inspiring fear  
whose his knees when set free are untiring  
the son who brings everything for Enlil 
and also that which gladdens the heart of Ninlil 
the king cares unceasingly for the lapis lazuli shrine 
At that time ImeDagan a copper statue which inspires fear as it races against the storm 
in the temple clad in fearsomeness upon his most precious dais 
he set it up and colored it brilliantly 
The great prince of the whole heaven the lord whose utterance cannot be altered 
his shining brow and raised righteous eyes 
and erases this inscription and writes his own name upon it 
or because of this curse incites another person to do it

Further copper figures whose bodily features

I dedicated them to her

No one should be allowed to split apart your good quality lapis lazuli among the beads of the gem cutter 
No one should be allowed to bend over the young woman Inanna dead in the netherworld 
Father Enki was replying to Ninubura 
The Ganzer gate alone before the netherworld its door was opened 
He was shouting to holy Inanna 
Come Inanna enter 
Come Inanna enter 
As she was entering the first gate 
She held the lapis measuring rod and line 
The man removed the turban the crown of the plain that was upon her head 
Be satisfied Inanna This is the rite of the netherworld that is being completed 
Inanna This is the procedure of the netherworld you should not speak aloud

Inanna This is the procedure of the netherworld you should not speak aloud 
As Inanna was entering the 6th gate 
What  
Be satisfied Inanna This is the rite of the netherworld that is being completed 
When she split apart the man brought  away 
Her sister raised her up from her throne 
The throne of her sister  
The seven judges of the Anuna judged her case before her 
She looked at her it was the look of death 
She shook her head  
For her Erekigal he turned her Inanna into a smitten piece of meat 
He hung her from a peg 
After seven years seven months and seven days elapsed 
She Ninubur scratched her face she scratched her nose 
She took a single path to the Ekur the temple of Enlil 
She entered the Ekur the temple of Enlil 
No one should be allowed to mix your good quality silver with the unrefined ore of the mountain 
No one should be allowed to split apart your boxwood among the wood of the carpenter 
Father Enlil no one should bend your child over dead in the netherworld 
No one should be allowed to mix your good quality silver with the unrefined ore of the mountain 
No one should be allowed to split apart your good quality lapis lazuli among the beads of the gem cutter 
No one should be allowed to split apart your boxwood among the wood of the carpenter 
No one should be allowed to mix your good quality silver with the unrefined ore of the mountain 
No one should be allowed to split apart your good quality lapis lazuli among the beads of the gem cutter 
No one should be allowed to split apart your boxwood among the wood of the carpenter 
No one should be allowed to bend over the young woman Inanna dead in the netherworld 
While enraged Enlil answered Ninubur 
My child wished for great heaven and the great earth 
From the great heaven she set her mind on the great below 
From the great heaven Inana set her mind on the great below 
My mistress abandoned heaven abandoned earth and descended to the underworld 
Inana abandoned heaven abandoned earth and descended to the underworld 
She abandoned the Eanna in Uruk and descended to the underworld 
She abandoned the Emukalam in Badtibira and descended to the underworld 
She abandoned the Giguna in zabala and descended to the underworld 
She abandoned the Baradurgara in Nibru and descended to the underworld 
She abandoned the Hursagkalama in Ki and descended to the underworld 
She abandoned the EUlma in Agade and descended to the underworld 
She abandoned the Ebgal in Umma and descended to the underworld 
She abandoned the EDilmuna in Ur and descended to the underworld 
She abandoned the Amaeku in Kisiga and descended to the underworld 
She abandoned the Eedamku in Girsu and descended to the underworld 
She abandoned the Esigmeedu in Isin and descended to the underworld 
She abandoned the Anzagar in Akak and descended to the underworld 
She abandoned the Nigingarku in uruppak and descended to the underworld 
She abandoned the Ecaghula in Kazallu and descended to the underworld 
She took the seven divine powers 
She collected the divine powers and grasped them in her hand 
With the good divine powers she went on her way 
She took a wig for her forehead 
She hung small lapislazuli beads around her neck 
She covered her body with a pala dress the garment of ladyship 
She placed mascara Let a man come let him come on her eyes 
She pulled the pectoral Come man come over her breast 
She placed a golden ring on her hand 
She held the lapislazuli measuring rod and measuring line in her hand 
Inanna traveled towards the underworld 
Holy Inanna says to Ninubur 
Come my faithful minister of Eanna 
my minister who speaks fair words 
On this day I will descend to the underworld 
When I have arrived in the underworld 
make a lament for me on the ruin mounds 
Make the rounds of the houses of the gods for me 
Lacerate your eyes for me lacerate your nose for me 
In private lacerate your buttocks for me 
Like a pauper clothe yourself in a single garment 
and all alone set your foot in the Ekur the house of Enlil 
When you have entered the Ekur the house of Enlil 
lament before Enlil 
Father Enlil dont let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld 
Dont let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone 
Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood 
Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld 
If Enlil does not help you in this matter go to Ur 
In the Emukura at Ur 
when you have entered the Ekinugal toward Nanna 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone 
Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood 
Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld 
And if Nanna does not help you in this matter go to Eridu 
In Eridu when you have entered the house of Enki 
lament before Enki 
Father Enki dont let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone 
Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood 
knows about the lifegiving plant and the lifegiving water 
When Inanna traveled on towards the underworld 
She says to her minister Ninubur 
Go now my Ninubur and pay attention 
Dont neglect the instructions I gave you 
When Inanna arrived at the palace Ganzer 
she pushed aggressively on the door of the underworld 
She shouted aggressively at the gate of the underworld 
Open up doorman open up 
Open up Neti open up I am all alone and I want to come in 
Neti the chief doorman of the underworld 
answers holy Inanna 
I am Inanna going to the east 
How did you set your heart on the road whose traveller never returns 
Holy Inanna answers him 
Because lord Gudgalana 
the husband of my elder sister holy Erekigal has died 
in order to have his funeral rites observed 
Neti the chief doorman of the underworld 
answers holy Inanna 
Stay here Inanna I will speak to my mistress 
Neti the chief doorman of the underworld 
to his mistress Erekigal 
entered the house and said 
My mistress there is a lone girl outside 
She pushed aggressively on the door of the underworld 
She shouted aggressively at the gate of the underworld 
She has abandoned Eanna and has descended to the underworld 
She has taken the 7 divine powers 
She has taken a wig for her forehead 
She has placed mascara Let a man come on her eyes 
She has pulled the pectoral Come man come over her breast 
She is holding the lapislazuli reed1ninda measuring rod and measuring line in her hand 
When she heard this Erekigal slapped the side of her thigh 
She bit her lip and took the words to heart 
She says to Neti her chief doorman 
Come Neti my chief doorman of the underworld 
dont neglect the instructions I will give you 
Then let each door of the palace Ganzer be opened separately 
As for her after she has entered 
and crouched down and had her clothes removed they will be carried away 
Neti the chief doorman of the underworld 
He bolted the 7 gates of the underworld 
Then he opened each of the doors of the palace Ganzer separately 
And when Inanna entered 
the turban headgear for the open country was removed from her head 
What is this 
Be satisfied Inanna a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled 
When she entered the 2nd gate 
What is this 
Inanna you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld 
When she entered the 3rd gate 
What is this 
Be satisfied Inanna a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled 
Inanna you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld 
What is this 
Be satisfied Inanna a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled 
the golden ring was removed from her hand 
What is this 
Be satisfied Inanna a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled 
Inanna you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld 
When she entered the 6th gate 
What is this 
Inanna you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld 
When she entered the 7th gate 
the pala dress the garment of ladyship was removed from her body 
Inanna you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld 
After she had crouched down and had her clothes removed they were carried away 
Then she made her sister Erekigal rise from her throne 
and instead she sat on her throne 
They looked at herit was the look of death 
They spoke to herit was the speech of anger 
They shouted at herit was the shout of heavy guilt 
And the corpse was hung on a hook 
After 3 days and 3 nights had passed 
her minister Ninubur 
carried out the instructions of her mistress 
She made a lament for her in her ruined houses 
She beat the drum for her in the sanctuaries 
She lacerated her eyes for her she lacerated her nose 
In private she lacerated her buttocks for her 
Like a pauper she clothed herself in a single garment 
and all alone she set her foot in the Ekur the house of Enlil 
Father Enlil dont let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld 
Dont let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone 
Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood 
Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld 
Inanna craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well 
The divine powers of the underworld are divine powers which should not be craved for whoever gets them must remain in the underworld 
Who having got to that place could then expect to come up again 
Thus father Enlil did not help in this matter so she went to Ur 
In the Emudkura at Ur 
she laments before Nanna 
Father Nanna dont let your daughter be killed in the underworld 
Dont let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone 
Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld 
In his rage father Nanna answers Ninubur 
My daughter craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well 
Inanna craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well 
The divine powers of the underworld are divine powers which should not be craved for whoever gets them must remain in the underworld 
Who having got to that place could then expect to come up again 
Thus father Nanna did not help her in this matter so she went to Eridu 
In Eridu when she had entered the house of Enki 
xshe laments before Enkixx 
Dont let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld 
Dont let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the masons stone 
Dont let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenters wood 
Dont let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld 
Father Enki answered Ninubur 
What has my daughter done She has me worried 
What has Inanna done She has me worried 
What has the mistress of all the lands done She has me worried 
He removed some dirt from the tip of his 2nd fingernail and created the galatur 
To the kurgar he gave the lifegiving plant 
To the galatura he gave the lifegiving water 
Then father Enki speaks out to the galatura and the kurgar 
Go and direct your steps to the underworld 
Flit past the door like flies 
Slip through the door pivots like phantoms 
The birthmother on account of her children 
Erekigal is lying there 
Her holy shoulders are not covered by a linen cloth 
Her breasts are not full like a cagan vessel 
Her nails are like a pickaxe  upon her 
The hair on her head is bunched up as if it were leeks 
you are to say You are troubled our mistress oh your heart 
When she says Oh my liver 
you are to say You are troubled our mistress oh your liver 
She will then ask Who are you 
Speaking to you from my heart to your heart from my liver to your liver 
if you are gods let me talk with you 
Make her swear this by heaven and earth 
Go on out 
But say to her Give us the corpse hanging on the hook 
She will answer That is the corpse of your queen 
Say to her Whether it is that of our king whether it is that of our queen give it to us 
She will give you the corpse hanging on the hook 
1 of you sprinkle on it the lifegiving plant and 1 the lifegiving water 
Thus let Inanna rise up 
The galatura and the kurgar paid attention to the instructions of Enki 
They slipped through the door pivots like phantoms 
The birthmother because of her children 
Erekigal was lying there 
Her holy shoulders were not covered by a linen cloth 
Her breasts were not full like a cagan vessel 
Her nails were like a pickaxe  upon her 
When she said Oh my heart 
they said to her You are troubled our mistress oh your heart 
they said to her You are troubled our mistress oh your liver 
Then she asked Who are you 
I tell you from my heart to your heart from my liver to your liver 
if you are mortals may a destiny be decreed for you 
They made her swear this by heaven and earth 
they were offered a river with its waterthey did not accept it 
They said to her Give us the corpse hanging on the hook 
The corpse is that of your queen 
They said to her Whether it is that of our king or that of our queen give it to us 
1 of them sprinkled on it the lifegiving plant and 1 the lifegiving water 
Erekigal says to the galatura and the kurgar 
Bring your queen  your  has been seized 
Inanna because of Enkis instructions was about to ascend from the underworld 
But as Inanna was about to ascend from the underworld 
Who has ever ascended from the underworld has ascended unscathed from the underworld 
If Inanna is to ascend from the underworld 
let her provide a substitute for herself 
So when Inanna left the underworld 
the one in front of her though not a minister held a sceptre in his hand 
and the big demons like the reeds of a fence restrained her on all sides 
Those who accompanied her 
those who accompanied Inanna 
eat no flour offering 
They accept no pleasant gifts 
They take away the child hanging on a wetnurses breasts 
They crush no bitter garlic 
They eat no fish they eat no leeks 
They it was who accompanied Inanna 
After Inanna had ascended from the underworld 
Ninubur threw herself at her feet at the door of the Ganzer 
The demons said to holy Inanna 
Holy Inanna answers the demons 
my escort of trustworthy words 
She made a lament for me on the ruin mounds 
She beat the drum for me in the sanctuaries 
She made the rounds of the gods houses for me 
She lacerated her eyes for me lacerated her nose for me 
Like a pauper she clothed herself in a single garment 
To the house of Enlil 
and to Ur to the house of Nanna 
and to Eridu to the house of Enki 
all alone she directed her steps 
She brought me back to life 
How could I turn her over to you 
At the egkuraga in Umma 
ara in his own city threw himself at her feet 
He had sat in the dust and dressed himself in a filthy garment 
The demons say to holy Inanna 
Inanna proceed to your city we will take him back 
Holy Inanna answered the demons 
my manicurist and my hairdresser 
How could I turn him over to you 
Let us go on Let us go on to the Emukalama in Badtibira 
At the Emukalama in Badtibira 
Lulal in his own city threw himself at her feet 
He had sat in the dust and clothed himself in a filthy garment 
The demons said to holy Inanna 
Inanna proceed to your city we will take him back 
Holy Inanna answers the demons 
Outstanding Lulal follows me at my right and my left 
Let us go on Let us go on to the great apple tree in the plain of Kulaba 
There was Dumuzi clothed in a magnificent garment and seated magnificently on a throne 
The demons seized him there by his thighs 
The 7 of them poured the milk from his churns 
The seven of them shook their heads like  
They would not let the shepherd play the pipe and flute before her  
She looked at him it was the look of death 
She shouted at him  it was the shout of heavy guilt 
Holy Inanna gave Dumuzi the shepherd into their hands 
Those who had accompanied her 
who had come for Dumuzi 
eat no flour offering 
drink no libation 
They never enjoy the pleasures of the marital embrace 
never have any sweet children to kiss 
They make the bride leave the house of her fatherinlaw 
Dumuzi let out a wail and turned very pale 
Utu you are my brotherinlaw 
I am your relation by marriage I brought butter oil to your mothers house 
Turn my hands into snakes hands 
and turn my feet into snakes feet 
so I can escape my demons let them not keep hold of me 
He turned his feet into snakes feet 
Holy Inanna  her heart 
Holy Inanna  her heart 
Holy Inanna  her heart 
Holy Inanna  Dumuzi  her heart  
 her husband  by force  
 like  
 like  
She tore at her hair like esparto grass she ripped it out like esparto grass 
You wives who lie in your mens embrace where is my precious husband 
Where is my man Where  
A fly speaks to holy Inanna 
If I show you where your man is what will be my reward 
Holy Inanna answers the fly 
If you show me where my man is I will give you this gift 
I will cover   
The young lady Inanna decreed the destiny of the fly 
In the beerhouse and the tavern  may there  for you 
You will live  like the sons of the wise 
Now Inanna decreed this fate and thus it came to be 
 was weeping 
Now alas my  
You for half the year and your sister for half the year 
when your sister is demanded on that day you will be released

After the flood had swept over 
and brought about the destruction of the countries 
and the seed of mankind was preserved 
and the blackheaded people all rose 
when An and Enlil 
called the name of mankind 
and established rulership 
but kingship and the crown of the city 
had not yet come out from heaven 
and Ningirsu the hoe and the spade 
the earth basket and the plough which mean life for the Land

lasted for 1 years 
and following his upbringing he lasted for another 1 years 
However he did not do any work 
He became smaller and smaller  
his sheep died  in the sheepfold 
In those days because the water of Laga was held back 
Canals were not dug 
the levees and ditches were not cleaned 
The large arable tracts were not  
the people relied on rain 
Anan did not make dappled barley grow 
furrows were not yet opened

Large fields with the plough 
The river  
In order to dig canals 
to  all the cultivated fields 
The pickaxe the spade the earth basket and the plough

From the years of AmarSuena 
of AmarSuena 
until King IbbiSuen 
chose Enamgalana by extispicy as the high priest of inanna of Uruk 
Written according to the words of Luinanna the chief leatherworker of Enlil 
IbiErra who looks after the Ekur 
built the storehouse of Enlil 
To  the sanctuary like a cargo ship
to  its great furnaces
to see that its canals  waters of joy for eternity
to see that the hoes till the arable tracts and that  the fields
to turn the house of Ki which was like a haunted town into a living settlement again
its king shepherd UrZababa
rose like Utu over the house of Ki
However to alter his term of reigning and to remove the prosperity of the palace
An and Enlil authoritatively  decided  by their holy command
Sargon  with happy heart
Since he was born 
One day after the evening had arrived
and Sargon had brought the regular deliveries to the palace
He UrZababa was sleeping and dreaming in the holy bedchamber his holy residence
He realised what the dream was about but did not put into words did not discuss it with anyone
After Sargon had received the regular deliveries for the palace
UrZababa appointed him cupbearer putting him in charge of the drinks cupboard
Holy inanna did not cease to stand by him
King UrZababa  and became frightened in his residence
He was troubled he was disturbed like a fish living in brackish water
It was then that the cupbearer of Ezinas winehouse
Sargon lay down not to sleep but lay down to dream
In the dream holy inanna drowned UrZababa in a river of blood
When King UrZababa heard about this groaning
he was brought into the kings holy presence
Sargon was brought into the presence of UrZababa who said
Cupbearer was a dream revealed to you in the night
Sargon answered his king
My king this is my dream which I will tell you about
There was a young woman who was as high as the heavens and as broad as the earth
She was firmly set as the base of a wall
For me she drowned you in a great river a river of blood
UrZababa chewed his lips he became seriously afraid
He spoke to  his chancellor
is going to change  my finger into a  of blood
she will drown Sargon the cupbearer in the great river
Belitikal chief smith man of my choosing who can write tablets
I will give you orders let my orders be carried out
in the Esikil the fated house throw them the mirror and Sargon into the mould like statues
Belitikal heeded his kings words
and prepared the moulds in the Esikil the fated house
The king spoke to Sargon
Sargon left the palace of UrZababa
Holy inanna however did not cease to stand at his right hand side
and before he had come within five or 1 ninda of the Esikil the fated house
holy inanna turned around toward him and blocked his way saying
Thus he met the chief smith of the king only at the gate of the fated house
After he delivered the kings bronze handmirror  to the chief smith
Belitikal the chief smith  and threw it into the mould like statues
After five or 1 days had passed Sargon
came into the presence of UrZababa his king
he came into the palace firmly founded like a great mountain
King UrZababa  and became frightened in his residence
He realised what was it about but did not put into words did not discuss it with anyone
He realised what was it about but did not put into words did not discuss it with anyone
In those days although writing words on tablets existed putting tablets into envelopes did not yet exist
to Lugalzagesi in Uruk
With the wife of Lugalzagesi 
She gave her feminity as a shelter 
Lugalzagesi did not  the envoy
Come He directed his steps to brickbuilt Eana
But as soon as he did talk to the envoy 
Alas and sat in the dust
Lugalzagesi replied to the envoy
Envoy Sargon does not yield
Sargon  Lugalzagesi 
Why  Sargon 
After Enlils frown 
had slain Ki as if it were the Bull of Heaven 
had slaughtered the house of the land of Uruk in the dust as if it were a mighty bull 
Then to Sargon king of Agade 
from the south as far as the highlands did Enlil 
as her celebrated womans domain 
Like a young man building a house for the first time 
like a girl establishing a womans domain 
So that the warehouses would be provisioned 
that dwellings would be founded in the city 
that its people would eat splendid food 
that its people would drink splendid beverages 
that those bathed for holidays would rejoice in the courtyards 
that acquaintances would dine together 
that foreigners would cruise about like unusual birds in the sky 
that even Marhai would be reentered on the tribute rolls 
that monkeys mighty elephants water buffalo exotic animals 
would jostle each other in the public squares 
as well as thoroughbred dogs lions mountain ibexes and alum sheep with long wool 
She then filled Agades stores for emmer wheat with gold 
she delivered copper tin and blocks of lapis lazuli to its granaries 
and sealed its silos from outside 
She endowed its old women with the gift of giving counsel 
she endowed its old men with the gift of eloquence 
she endowed its young men with martial might 
she endowed its little ones with joy 
The nursemaids who cared for the generals children 
Inside the city tigi drums sounded outside it flutes and zamzam instruments 
Its harbour where ships moored was full of joy 
All foreign lands rested contentedly 
Its king the shepherd NaramSuen 
rose as the daylight on the holy throne of Agade 
Its city wall like a mountain reached the heavens 
Its citygates were like the Tigris going to the sea 
when Inanna opened its portals 
and made Sumer bring its own possessions upstream by boats 
The Meluans the people of the black land 
Elam and Subir loaded themselves with goods for her as if they were packasses 
All the governors the temple administrators 
and the accountants of the Guedina 
regularly supplied the monthly and New Year offerings 
What a weariness all these caused at Agades city gates 
Holy inanna could hardly receive all these offerings 
As if she were a citizen there she could not restrain  the desire  to prepare the ground for a temple 
But the statement coming from the Ekur was disquieting 
Because of Enlil  all Agade was reduced  to trembling 
She left the city returning to her home 
Holy inanna abandoned the sanctuary of Agade 
and handed them over to the enemy 
Not even five or 1 days had passed 
and the jewels of rulership the royal crown 
did Ninurta bring back into his Eumea 
Utu took away the eloquence of the city 
Enki took away its wisdom 
Its fearsomeness that reaches heaven 
Enki tore out from the abzu 
inanna took away its weapons 
Like a mighty elephant it bent its neck to the ground 
Like a dying dragon it dragged its head on the earth 
and they jointly deprived it of honour as in a battle 
Enlil would not let the kingdom of Agade occupy a pleasant lasting residence 
that he would make its future altogether unfavourable 
that he would make its temples shake and would scatter its treasures  
 temples shake  
covered his chariot with a reed mat 
tore the reed canopy off his ceremonial barge 
NaramSuen persisted for seven years 
Who has ever seen a king burying his head in his hands for seven years 
He realised what the dream was about but did not put into words and did not discuss it with anyone 
Then he went to perform extispicy on a kid regarding the temple 
but the omen had nothing to say about the building of the temple 
For a second time he went to perform extispicy on a kid regarding the temple 
but the omen again had nothing to say about the building of the temple 
In order to change what had been inflicted  upon him 
he tried to to alter Enlils pronouncement 
Because his subjects were dispersed 
he now began a mobilization of his troops 
Like a wrestler who is about to enter the great courtyard 
he  his hands towards  the Ekur 
Like an athlete bent to start a contest 
he treated the giguna as if it were worth only thirty shekels 
Like a robber plundering the city 
he set tall ladders against the temple 
to prostrate it like a city inundated by Ikur 
alhough the temple was not the Mountains of Cedarfelling 
he had large axes cast 
he had doubleedged agasilig axes sharpened to be used against it 
He set spades against its roots 
and the temple like a dead soldier bowed its neck before him 
and all the foreign lands bowed their necks before him 
and all the rain went back to the heavens 
He tore off its upper lintel and the Land was deprived of its ornament 
From its Gate from which Grain is never Diverted he diverted grain 
and the Land was deprived of grain 
and wellbeing was subverted in all the foreign lands 
As if they were for great tracts of land with wide carpfilled waters 
The people could see the bedchamber its room which knows no daylight 
They could look into the holy treasure chest of the gods 
its laama deities of the great pilasters standing at the temple 
though they had committed no sacrilege 
were thrown into the fire by NaramSuen 
The cedar cypress juniper and boxwood 
He put its gold in containers 
He filled the docks with its copper as if it were a huge transport of grain 
The silversmiths were reshaping its silver 
jewellers were reshaping its precious stones 
smiths were beating its copper 
Though they were not the goods of a plundered city 
large ships were moored at the temple 
large ships were moored at Enlils temple 
As the ships moved away from the docks Agades intelligence was removed 
The roaring storm that subjugates the entire land 
the rising deluge that cannot be confronted 
Enlil was considering what should be destroyed in return for the wrecking of his beloved Ekur 
He lifted his gaze towards the Gubin mountains 
and made all the inhabitants of the broad mountain ranges descend  
Those who do not resemble other people who are not reckoned as part of the Land 
the Gutians an unbridled people 
Like small birds they swooped on the ground in great flocks 
Because of Enlil they stretched their arms out across the plain like a net for animals 
Nothing escaped their clutches 
Messengers no longer travelled the highways 
the couriers boat no longer passed along the rivers 
The Gutians drove the trusty  goats of Enlil out of their folds and compelled their herdsmen to follow them they drove the cows out of their pens and compelled their cowherds to follow them 
they drove the cows out of their pens and compelled their cowherds to follow them 
Prisoners manned the watch 
Brigands occupied the highways 
The doors of the city gates of the Land lay dislodged in mud 
and all the foreign lands uttered bitter cries from the walls of their cities 
They established gardens for themselves within the cities and not as usual on the wide plain outside 
the large arable tracts yielded no grain 
the inundated tracts yielded no fish 
the thick clouds  did not rain the magurum plant did not grow 
grain for one shekel was only half a litre 
those who lay down in the house were not buried 
People were flailing at themselves from hunger 
By the Kiur Enlils great place 
dogs were packed together in the silent streets 
if two men walked there they would be devoured by them 
noses  were piled up heads were sown like seeds 
heroes lay dead on top of heroes 
the blood of traitors ran upon the blood of honest men 
At that time Enlil rebuilt his great sanctuaries 
into small reed  sanctuaries 
and from east to west he reduced their storehouses 
The old women who survived those days 
and the chief lamentation singer who survived those years 
for seven days and seven nights 
set up seven bala drums 
ub meze and lilis drums made them resound to Enlil like Ikur 
Its young women did not restrain from tearing their hair 
were performing a lament in the aweinspiring Holy Mound by the holy knees of Enlil 
Because of this Enlil entered his holy bedchamber and lay down fasting 
cooled Enlils heart with cool water and prayed to him 
May the one that defiled your giguna be treated as Nibru 
In this city may heads fill the wells 
May no one find his acquaintances there 
may brother not recognise brother 
May its young woman be cruelly killed in her womans domain 
may its old man cry in distress for his slain wife 
may its small birds be smitten in their nooks 
may it live in constant anxiety like a timid pigeon 
Again Suen Enki inanna Ninurta Ikur Utu Nuska and Nisaba all the gods whosoever 
turned their attention to the city 
Agade you pounced on Ekur it is as if you had pounced on Enlil 
May your holy walls to their highest point resound with mourning 
May your giguna be reduced to a pile of dust 
May your pilasters with the standing lahama deities 
fall to the ground like tall young men drunk on wine 
May your clay be returned to its abzu 
may it be clay cursed by Enki 
may it be grain cursed by Ezina 
may it be timber cursed by Ninilduma 
may your sheep butcher butcher his child 
May your prostitute hang herself at the entrance to her brothel 
May your pregnant  priestesses and cult prostitutes abort  their children 
may your silver be bought for the price of pyrite  
and may your copper be bought for the price of lead 
Agade may your strong man be deprived of his strength 
so that he will be unable to lift his sack of provisions and  
and will not have the joy of controlling your superior asses may he lie idle all day 
May this make the city die of hunger 
May your citizens who used to eat fine food lie hungry 
may your  man 
eat the coating on his roof 
The leather hinges on the main door of his fathers house 
May depression descend upon your palace built for joy 
May the evils of the desert the silent place howl continuously 
Your uzga precinct established for purification ceremonies 
Your gateways established for the Land 
May the ukuku the bird of depression make its nest in them 
In your city that could not sleep because of the tigi drums 
that could not rest from its joy 
may the bulls of Nanna that fill the pens 
bellow like those who wander in the desert the silent place 
May the grass grow long on your canalbank towpaths 
may the grass of mourning grow on your highways laid for waggons 
Moreover on your towpaths built up with canal sediment 
may  wild rams  and alert snakes of the mountains allow no one to pass 
In your plains where fine grass grows may the reed of lamentation grow 
And before Utu on that very day so it was 
On its canal bank towpaths the grass grew long 
On its highways laid for waggons the grass of mourning grew 
Moreover on its towpaths built up with canal sediment 
On its plains where fine grass grew now the reeds of lamentation grew 
Agades flowing fresh water flowed as brackish water 
When someone decided I will dwell in that city he could not enjoy the pleasures of a dwelling place 
When someone decided I will rest in Agade 
For the destruction of Agade Inanna be praised 
Enki took away its wisdom 
Its fearsomeness that reaches heaven 
Its wellanchored holy mooring pole 
Enki tore it out from the abzu 
that he would make its temples shake and would scatter its treasures  
His subjects were dispersed 
so he began a mobilization of his troops 
Like a wrestler who is about to enter the great courtyard 
he  his hands towards  the Ekur 
Like an athlete bent to start a contest 
he treated the giguna as if it were worth only thirty shekels 
Like a robber plundering the city 
he set tall ladders against the temple 
Though the temple was not a mountain of cedars 
He had doubleedged agasilig axes sharpened to be used against it 
As if they were for great tracts of land with huge carpfilled waters 
He put spades against its roots 
He struck the Gate of WellBeing with the pickaxe 
Noses were punched heads were smashed  
Noses were punched heads were smashed  
Noses were punched heads were smashed  
Noses were punched heads were smashed  
noses  were piled up heads were sown like seeds 
Heroes lay  dead on top of heroes 
the blood of traitors ran  upon honest men

Together with the lord whose house had been devastated his city was given over to tears 
The good woman to disquiet the lord concerning his city 
Ningal to give him no rest concerning his Land 
She approached the lord for the sake of his house  bitterly she weeps 
She approached him for the sake of his devastated house  before him she makes its bitter lament 
The woman after she had composed her song  for the tearful balag instrument 
The storm that came to be  its lamentation hangs heavy on me 
Raging about because of the storm 
I trembled on account of that day 
Because of this debilitating storm I could not see a good day for my rule not one good day for my rule 
The bitter lament having come to be for me during the night 
trembled on account of that night 
but I did not flee before the nights violence 
Because of its existence in my nightly sleeping place even in my nightly sleeping place truly there was no peace for me 
2 mss add 1 line Truly I did not forsake my Land 
Because there was bitterness in my Land 
I trudged the earth like a cow for its calf 
My Land was not granted success 
Because there was bitter distress in my city 
I beat my wings like a bird of heaven 
and flew to my city 
and my city was destroyed in its foundations 
and Ur perished where it lay 
Because the hand of the storm appeared above 
Indeed they established weeping and lamentation for me 
As for the house which used to be where the spirit of the blackheaded people was soothed 
instead of its festivals wrath and terror indeed multiply 
my devastated righteous house upon which no eye had been cast 
depression and lament and bitterness 
lament and bitterness have been brought into it 
My house founded by the righteous 
was pushed over on its side like a garden fence 
For Ekinugal my house of royalty 
the good house my house which has been given over to tears 
as onto a shelter on the denuded harvest ground wind and rain have been made to fall on it 
Ur my allsurpassing chamber 
the house and the smitten city all have been uprooted 
The swamp has swallowed my possessions accumulated in the city

On that day when such a storm had pounded 
on that day when such a storm had been created 
when they had pronounced the utter destruction of my city 
when they had pronounced the utter destruction of Ur 
on that day I did not abandon my city 
I did not forsake my land 
Truly I shed my tears before An 
Truly I myself made supplication to Enlil 
Let not my city be destroyed I implored them 
Let not its people perish I implored them 
I prostrated  myself and stretched out my arms 
Truly I shed my tears before An 
Let not Ur be destroyed I implored them 
But An did not change that word 
Enlil did not soothe my heart with an It is good  so be it 
They decreed its destiny that its people should be killed 
In return for the speech  which I had given them 
they both bound me together with my city 
and also bound my Ur together with me 
An is not one to change his command 
and Enlil does not alter what he has uttered

A fiery glow burns with the raging storm 
After the haze had lifted at noon he made fires blaze 
He locked up the day and the rising of the bright sun together with the good storm 
In the Land he did not let the bright sun rise it shone like the evening star 
The scorching potsherds made the dust glow   the people groan 
He swept the winds over the blackheaded people  the people groan 
Sumer was overturned by a snare  the people groan 
Tears cannot influence the bitter storm  the people groan 
The reaping storm dragged across the Land

On its lofty citygates where walks had been taken corpses were piled 
In all its streets where walks had been taken corpses were piled 
In its places where the dances of the Land had taken place people were stacked in heaps 
They made the blood of the Land flow down the wadis like copper or tin 
The heads of its men slain by the axe were not covered with a cloth 
Men struck down by the spear were not bound with bandages 
As if in the place where their mothers had laboured they lay in their own blood 
Its men who were finished off by the battlemace were not bandaged with new  cloth

They broke up the good house with pickaxes 
They reduced the city to ruin mounds

Azimua the queen of the city wept bitter tears 
Alas the destroyed city my destroyed house 
On that day the storm forced people to live in darkness 
In order to destroy Kuara it forced people to live in darkness 
Alas the destroyed city my destroyed house 
Asarlui put his robes on with haste and  
Lugalbanda took an unfamiliar path away from his beloved dwelling 
1 ms adds Ninsumun  
Alas the destroyed city my destroyed house 
Eridug floating on great waters was deprived  of drinking water 
In its outer environs which had turned into haunted plains  
I not destroyed by the storm my attractiveness not brought to an end  
We have been struck down like beautiful boxwood trees 
We have been struck down like  with coloured eyes 
The Gutians the vandals are wiping us out 
We turned to Father Enki in the abzu of Eridug 
 whatever we shall say whatever we shall add 
we came out from the  of Eridug 
While were in charge of  during the day the shadows  
What do we receive trembling on duty during the day 
What do we lose not sleeping on duty during the night 
Enki your city has been cursed it has been given to an enemy land 
Why do they reckon us among those who have been displaced from Eridug 
Why do they destroy us like palm trees which we have not tended 
Why do they break us up like new boats we have not caulked 
After Enki had cast his eyes on a foreign land 
 have risen up have called on their cohorts 
Enki took an unfamiliar path away from Eridug 
Damgalnuna the mother of the Ema wept bitter tears 
Its sacred ipar of en priesthood was defiled 
Its en priestess was snatched from the ipar and carried off to enemy territory 
In Ur no one went to fetch food no one went to fetch water 
Those who went to fetch food went away from the food and will not return 
Those who went to fetch water went away from the water and will not return 
To the south the Elamites stepped in slaughtering  
The Tidnum daily strapped the mace to their loins 
To the south the Elamites like an onrushing wave were  
Ur like a great charging wild bull bowed its neck to the ground 
This is what Enlil who decides the fates did 
Again he sent down the Elamites the enemy from the mountains 
The foremost house firmly founded  
In order to destroy Kisiga 1 men even five men  
Three days and three nights did not pass  the city was raked by a hoe 
To the holy house  
She rode away from her possessions she went to the mountains 
She rode away from her possessions she went to the mountains 
She rode away from her possessions she went to the mountains 
She rode away from her possessions she went to the mountains 
She rode away from her possessions she went to the mountains 
I am queen but I shall have to ride away from my possessions and now I shall be a slave in those parts 
I shall have to ride away from my silver and lapis lazuli and now I shall be a slave in those parts 
There slavery  people who can  it 
There slavery Elam  who can  it 
My queen though not the enemy went to enemy land

Enlil threw open the door of the grand gate to the wind 
Enlil threw open the door of the grand gate to the wind 
Enlil threw open the door of the grand gate to the wind 
Enlil threw open the door of the grand gate to the wind 
In Ur no one went to fetch food no one went to fetch water 
Their strength ebbed away they could not even go on their way 
Enlil afflicted the city with an evil famine 
He afflicted the city with that which cannot be withstood with weapons 
He afflicted the city with dissatisfaction and treachery 
In Ur which was like a solitary reed there was not even fear 
At the royal station  there was no food on top of the platform  
The king who used to eat marvellous food grabbed at a mere ration 
There was no beer in the beerhall there was no more malt for it 
There was no food for him in his palace it was unsuitable to live in 
Grain did not fill his lofty storehouse he could not save his life 
The grainpiles and granaries of Nanna held no grain 
The evening meal in the great dining hall of the gods was defiled 
Wine and syrup ceased to flow in the great dining hall 
The butchers knife that used to slay oxen and sheep lay hungry 
The sounds of the bursag building the pure  of Nanna were stilled 
The house which used to bellow like a bull was silenced 
Its holy deliveries were no longer fulfilled its  were alienated 
The mortar pestle and grinding stone lay idle no one bent down over them 
The Shining Quay of Nanna was silted up 
Dust piled up in the unuribanda of Nanna 
The rushes grew the rushes grew the mourning reeds grew 
Boats and barges ceased docking at the Shining Quay 
Nothing moved on your watercourse which was fit for barges 
The boat with firstfruit offerings of the father who begot Nanna no longer brought firstfruit offerings 
Its food offerings could not be taken to Enlil in Nibru 
Its watercourse was empty barges could not travel 
There were no paths on either of its banks long grass grew there 
The reed fence of the wellstocked cattlepen of Nanna was split open 
The gardens fence was vioilated and breached 
The cows and their young were captured and carried off to enemy territory 
The munzerfed cows took an unfamiliar path in an open country that they did not know 
Gayau who loves cows dropped his weapon in the dung 
unidug who stores butter and cheese did not store butter and cheese 
Those who are unfamiliar with butter were churning the butter 
Those who are unfamiliar with milk were curdling  the milk 
Like mighty coals that once burnt its smoke is extinguished 
The great dining hall of Nanna  
Suen wept to his father Enlil 
O father who begot me why have you turned away from my city which was built  for you 
O Enlil why have you turned away from my Ur which was built  for you 
The boat with firstfruit offerings no longer brings firstfruit offerings to the father who begot him 
The en priests of the countryside and city have been carried off by phantoms 
Ur like a city raked by a hoe is to be counted as a ruinmound 
The Duur Enlils restingplace has become a haunted shrine 
O Enlil gaze upon your city an empty wasteland 
Gaze upon your city Nibru an empty wasteland 
The dogs of Ur no longer sniff at the base of the city wall 
My father who begot me enclose in your embrace my city which is all alone 
Enlil return to your embrace my Ur which is all alone 
Enclose in your embrace my Ekinugal which is all alone 
May you bring forth offspring in Ur may you multiply its people 
May you restore the divine powers of Sumer that have been forgotten 
O good house good house O its people its people 
igigal 
Enlil then answered his son Suen 
There is lamentation in the haunted city reeds of mourning grow there 
In its midst the people pass their days in sighing 
1 ms adds 1 line My son the noble son  why do you concern yourself with crying 
Oh Nanna the noble son  why do you concern yourself with crying 
The judgment uttered by the assembly cannot be reversed 
The word of An and Enlil knows no overturning 
Ur was indeed given kingship but it was not given an eternal reign 
From time immemorial since the Land was founded until people multiplied 
who has ever seen a reign of kingship that would take precedence for ever 
O my Nanna do not exert yourself in vain abandon your city 
Then my king the noble son became distraught 
Lord Aimbabbar the noble son grieved 
Suen took an unfamiliar path away from his beloved Ur 
Ningal quickly clothed herself and left the city 
The Anuna stepped outside of Ur 
 approached Ur 
The trees of Ur were sick its reeds were sick 
Laments sounded all along its city wall 
Daily there was slaughter before it 
Large axes were sharpened in front of Ur 
The spears the arms of battle were prepared 
Large stones fell toegether with great thuds 
1 ms adds 1 line Daily the evil wind returned in the city 
Ur confident in its own strength stood ready for the murderers 
Its people oppressed by the enemy could not withstand their weapons 
In the city those who had not been felled by weapons succumbed to hunger 
This hunger contorted peoples faces twisted their muscles 
Its king breathed heavily in his own palace 
Its people dropped their weapons their weapons hit the ground 
They struck their necks with their hands and cried 
How long until we are finished off by this catastrophe 
Inside Ur there is death outside it there is death 
Inside it we are to be finished off by famine Outside it we are to be finished off by Elamite weapons 
In Ur the enemy oppresses us oh we are finished 
The people took refuge  behind the city walls They were united in fear 
The palace that was destroyed by onrushing water was defiled its doorbolts were torn out 
In Ur weapons smashed heads like clay pots 
Its refugees were unable to flee they were trapped inside the walls 
1 ms adds 3 lines Like fish living in a pond they tried to escape 
The enemy seized the Ekinugal of Nanna 
The statues that were in the shrine were cut down 
The great stewardess Ninigara ran away from the storehouse 
Its throne was cast down before it she threw herself down into the dust 
Its unblemished oxen and grassfed sheep were slaughtered 
The palmtrees strong as mighty copper the heroic strength 
Their date spadices that used to fall  on the well were torn out 
The fertile reeds which grew in the sacred  were defiled 
The great tribute that they had collected was hauled off to the mountains 
lay before it like heroes smitten by heroes 
Its gapingmouthed dragons and its aweinspiring lions 
1 ms adds 1 line Its architrave  gold and lapis lazuli 
The glory of the house whose glory was once so lovely was extinguished 
Like a storm that fills all the lands it was built there like twilight in the heavens 
its doors adorned with the heavenly stars 
its  Great bronze latches  were torn out 
Its hinges  Together with its door fittings it  wept bitterly like a fugitive 
The bolt the holy lock and the great door were not fastened for it 
The noise of the door being fastened had ceased 
The  and was put out in the square 
The food offerings  of his royal dining place were altered 
Its mighty tigi  did not perform its sacred song 
There was no eloquence in the Dublama the place where oaths used to be taken 
The throne was not set up at its place of judgment justice was not administered 
Alamu threw down his sceptre his hands trembling 
The sacred box that no one had set eyes upon was seen by the enemy 
The statues that were in the shrine were cut down 
The cook the dream interpreter and the seal keeper did not perform the ceremonies properly 
They stood by submissively and were carried off by the foreigners 
forsook the divine plans and sacred divine powers they went off to a foreign city 
In his grief Suen approached his father 
He went down on his knee in front of Enlil the father who begot him 
O father who begot me how long will the enemy eye be cast upon my account how long  
he lordship and the kingship that you bestowed  
Father Enlil the one who advises with just words 
the wise words of the Land  
your inimical judgment 
look into your darkened heart terrifying like waves 
as for my hairstyle  of lordship and the diadem with which I was crowned 
 he put on a garment of mourning 
Enlil then provided a favourable response to his son Suen 
My son the city built for you in joy and prosperity was given to you as your reign 
 the black black days of the reign that has been your lot 
As for dwelling in your home the Etemenniguru that was properly built  
 indeed Ur shall be rebuilt in splendour the people shall bow down to you 
There is to be bounty at its base there is to be grain 
There is to be splendour at its top the sun shall rejoice there 
Let an abundance of grain embrace its table 
May Ur the city whose fate was pronounced by An be restored for you 
Having pronounced his blessing Enlil raised his head toward the heavens 
May the land south and highland be organised for Nanna 
Like a cloud hugging the earth they shall submit to him 
By order of An and Enlil it shall be conferred 
Father Nanna came into his city of Ur with head raised high 
Ningal refreshed herself in her sacred living quarters 
1 ms adds 1 line In Ur she could enter again into her Ekinugal

 how did it become a haunted place When will it be restored 
Where once the brick of fate had been laid  
how did the storeroom of Nibru the shrine Duranki 
become a haunted place When will it be restored 
after the brickwork of Ekur had been built 
after the shrine Egalma had been built  
 how did they become haunted When will they be restored 
How did the true city become empty 
Its precious designs have been defiled 
How were the citys festivals neglected 
Its magnificent rites have been thrown into disorder 
In the heart of Nibru where the divine powers were allotted 
and the blackheaded people prolificly multiplied 
the citys heart no longer revealed any sign of intelligence  
 there where the Anuna used to give advice 
they no longer impart decisions or justice 
Where its gods had established their dwellings 
where their daily rations were offered their daises erected 
where the sacred royal offering  and the evening meal in their great banquet hall 
were destined for the pouring out of choice beer and syrup  
 Nibru the city where in its spreading shade 
 in their dwellings Enlil fell upon them as if they were criminals 
The inner city whose bitter tears were overwhelming 
How long until its lady the goddess Ninlil would ask after it 
as though it were empty wasteland no one enters it 
For how long would Enlil neglect that Land ears lamentation depression and despair 
Why were those who once played the em and ala drums 
spending their time in bitter lamenting 
Why were the lamenters sitting in its brick buildings 
The men whose wives had fallen whose children had fallen 
were singing Oh our destroyed city 
Their city gone their homes abandoned  
 as those who were singing for the brick buildings of the good city 
as the lamenters of wailing 
the people were smitten their minds thrown into disorder 
The true temple wails bitterly 
1st kirugu 
Its gigigal 
 it sings a bitter song of the proper cleansingrites that are forgotten 
The brickwork of Ekur gave you only tears and lamentation  
 it sings a bitter song of the proper cleansingrites that are forgotten 
 its most sacred food rations neglected and  into funeral offerings it cries Alas 
The temple despairs of its divine powers utterly cleansed pure hallowed which are now defiled 
because they have finished off its populace there like animals it cries Oh my Land 
Because they have piled up the young women young men and their little children like heaps of grain it cries Woe for them 
Because they have splashed their blood on the ground like a rainstorm there is no restraint to its crying 
The temple like a cow whose calf is cut off groans bitterly to itself 
it is griefstricken and the sweetvoiced lamenters like nursemaids singing a lullaby respond tearfully with its name 
In anguish they bewail the fact that the citys lord has smashed heads there 
that he has looked away from it and toward a foreign land instead 
The true temple of all the countries which had come before him  
the blackheaded people who had taken a true path 
what have they done regarding what have they forsaken 
that their lord has become enraged with them and walks in anger 
2nd kirugu 
It voices bitter cries because he has removed the great divine powers from within it 
Its gigigal 
How long will he not turn to it not say Alas for it 
Why did he cut off the road to its brickwork 
He made the noisy pigeons fly away from their windows 
Why did he transform the appearance of the temple which knew voices where they used to while away the days in sweet playing of tigi drums in the brick buildings 
The temple once a place to offer salutations in humility 
is now as deathly silent as a temple which no one reveres 
As though its purification priests equipment were not utterly sacred 
among dejection and lamentation he has made it a sacrilege 
After its fate how long till his face would be streaked with teardrops 
He rejected it thus as though it were a blasphemy 
Night and day he has filled its heart with tears 
has destroyed that city and its temples 
He has ripped out their foundations struck them with the adze 
killed wives and their children within it 
he has turned that city into a deserted city  
 when would he restore its ancient property 
Its possessions have been carried off by the wind 
Enlil turned the city which used to be there into a city no longer 
He made its mind wander 
He threw its intelligence into disorder and made it haunted 
He took away its food and its water 
He brought to an end its days of familiarity with milk and with beer 
he has made its eyes blurred with tears 
The lamenters who perform the dirges 
The citys lord who has removed its divine powers  
no one touches his arm no one intercedes 
3rd kirugu 
How did Enlil make all his greatest divine powers fly away 
No one ever touches his arm No one ever intercedes 
To my dirge singer of bitter fates 
I am going down and I shall weep tearfully to him 
Even now the lamenters who are expert in song 
Now my people who are overcome by hardship 
have been made known to me 
My people whose hearts have been broken on the bitter way 
perform the lullabies of my young ones for me in tears 
were falsely founded and they have been eroded by the winds 
Of how the foe has finished off my Land 
They are making a lament 
They are addressing the cries of my heart overwhelmed with bitterness in order to soothe it 
They are beginning their laments about my lord 
He will have mercy and compassion on me  
Enlil father of the blackheaded people

Say Reenter for me your dwelling in my darkened shrines

He will fix it forever as your lot that you shall lift your head high 
he will make good again the hostilities he is directing against you

He stood there before the hero 
his provider ImeDagan and issued the command to him to completely rebuild the Ekur the most precious shrine 
to restore its ziggurat temple to make it shine like the day 
to make fitting the dais upon its platform 
He has put back in their place the rites which the enemy disordered and desecrated 
along with the scattered divine powers 
The cleansingrites which the enemy had put a stop to 
so that they should sanctify and purify again 
he has given him his sacred unchangeable decision 
When decrees the fate of the sacred royal offering place  he will offer salutations 
and stand there daily in supplication and prayer 
Your bitter tears 
Your bitter tears 
How long before you will rest at ease

How long will the brickwork strain its eyes upwards in tears and lamentations 
Even now your lord the Great Mountain Enlil supreme in the universe 
Now city your lord who has had compassion and mercy for you 
Father Enlil lord of all countries who has commanded that you be restored 
and the great mother Ninlil who entreated him in prayer there 
and the brickwork itself which said to him Steady the trembling of Nibru 
and said to him Rebuild my womens quarters for me Reestablish my temples for me  
 he who mulled things over so that he came to a decision about them 
Enlil who found agreeable his command of true words 
who beneficently entered the true temple which had suffered destruction  
 he himself is removing what he turned upon you in distress 
Just as he silenced you when he made joy enter again 
he decreed as your fate the sound of choice beer and syrup being poured out to overflowing 
Enough It is time to stifle the lament he said to you himself 
Because you have been living in a state of neglect Enlil who has decreed your fate 
Nibru he has decreed your great fate and made your reign long 
Enlil himself has commanded ImeDagan that the Ekur should shine like the day 
Steady sunlight shines into the Kiur he has brought daylight in there again for you 
Ninlil has decreed your fate in the agiua 
Enlil and Ninlil together founded daises in the Ekur 
They dined there and enjoyed choice beer 
They deliberated how to make the blackheaded people secure in their dwellings 
They have gathered back together the children whom they turned away from their mothers

He himself has raised up the day for the Kiurs magnificent manifestation 
He himself has restored the day for Sumer and Akkad to expand 
He himself has set aside the day for houses to be built and storerooms to be enclosed 
He himself has brought out the day for seeds to sprout and living things to be born 
He has brought out the day for building cattle pens and founding sheepfolds 
he ewes which bore lambs have filled the pens 
Ewes have given birth in the folds their lambs have filled the pens

All the great gods paled at its immensity and  was brought about 
Like a great wild bull which bellows mightily that one filled the world with its roar 
As its gigantic horns reached up to heaven who trembled in his very core 
As it was piled up over the mountains like a battlenet who turned away 
Who caused wailing and lamenting in those streets and  
Uruk like a loyal citizen in terror set up an alarm 
and exclaimed Rise up Why did its hand seize Uruk Why did the benevolent eye look away 
Who desecrated the fearsome radiance which crowned it 
Who brought about mob panic in Uruk Who  sickness too 
Along with the city the foreign lands  who  in the temple of Uruk 
Who made

He consoled himself with tears and laments  the city trembled 
The fearsome radiance overwhelmed like  
The faithful cowherds themselves overturned every single cattlepen 
They built them up like grain heaps they spread them out like grain piles 
they were convulsed  they drenched the fields with water they turned the city into a swamp 
They did all that Like reeds in a wasteland life could not be revived 
They brought ruination Evil things menaced  the city 
Its guardian spirit though not an enemy was exiled  to a foreign place 
Thus all its most important gods evacuated Uruk they kept away from it 
They hid out in the hills and wandered  about in the haunted plains 
In the city built upon peace food and drink were overturned like a saman vessel 
In the pasture lands a tumultuous noise arose the asses and sheep were driven away 
Elderly people and babies taking their rest  in front

He  and turned the place into dust 
He  and piled the people up in heaps 
 how long until its charms are restored 
The  of heaven  and the people  to the limits of heaven 
Its gigigal 
He  stretched forth his hand and induced terror in the land 
Enlil struck out with great ferocity He announced 
A deluge dashing the hoe on the ground shall be invoked 
At its front war shall be a  axe at its rear it shall be a  
Its overgrown hair shall be a harrow its back shall be flames 
Its countenance shall be a malevolent storm that enshrouds heaven and earth 
Its tongue shall be an inferno raining embers that sunders the Land 
Its arms shall be the majestic Anzud bird that nothing can escape when it spreads wide its talons 
Its ribs shall be crowbars that let light pass inside like the suns rays 
Knotted at both its hips shall be citydestroying slingstones 
Its great haunches shall be dripping knives covered with gore that make blood flow 
Its muscles shall be saws that slash its feet those of an eagle 
It shall make the Tigris and Euphrates quaver it shall make the mountains rumble 
At its reverberation the hills shall be uprooted the people shall be pitched about like sheaves 
The foolish shall rejoice they shall exclaim  
Let it come  we shall be seeing war and battle in the city 
how the sacred precinct  is destroyed how the walls are battered down how the citys peace is disrupted 
how among the loyal families honest men are transformed into traitors 
But the sensible shall beat their breasts and droop  their heads 
At midnight they shall be afraid and tearful and suffer insomnia 
In bed under the covers they shall be unable to sleep soundly they shall wander about the city 
May our allies serving in times of war raise their forces for peace 
May the word of Enlil be sent back may it turn tail 
May the venom of Nunamnirs anger become exhausted 
May those vicious men who have seized the Ekur be punished 
May those who have set their sight upon Nibru be swept away

Enki shut  the great door of Eridug 
Nudimmud withdrew into his bedchamber and lay down fasting 
Utu did not come forth in the sky and the day was full of sorrow 
Because of the fate decreed for UrNamma

Sweet sleep did not come to the people whose happiness  
they passed their time in lamentation over the trustworthy shepherd who had been snatched away 
As the early flood was filling the canals their canalinspector was already silenced  
the mottled barley grown on the arable lands the life of the land was inundated 
To the farmer the fertile fields planted  by him yielded little 
Enkimdu the lord of levees and ditches took away the levees and ditches from Ur

His donkeys were to be found with UrNamma they were buried with him 
The journey to the nether world is a desolate route 
Because of the king the chariots were covered over the roads were thrown into disorder no one could go up and down on them 
He presented gifts to the seven chief porters of the nether world 
As the famous kings who had died

As they announced UrNammas coming to the people a tumult arose in the nether world 
The king slaughtered numerous bulls and sheep 
UrNamma seated the people at a huge banquet 
The food of the nether world is bitter the water of the nether world is brackish

Ninsumun no longer rests her august arm firmly on her head 
Nanna Lord Aimbabbar no longer leads  her by the hand 
Enki the lord of Eridug does not  
Her  has been silenced  she can no longer answer 
She is cast adrift like a boat in a raging storm the mooring pole has not been strong enough for her 
Like a wild ass lured  into a perilous pit she has been treated heavyhandedly 
Like a dog kept in a cage she is silenced 
Utu  does not pay heed to the cries Oh my king overwhelming her 
My tigi adab flute and zamzam songs have been turned into laments because of me 
The instruments of the house of cantorship have been propped against the wall 
Instead of my throne whose beauty was endless 
I have been made to  in a soilfilled pit 
Instead of my bed the sleeping place whose  was endless 
I have been made to lie down in the open desolate steppe 
My wife and my children are in tears and wailing 
My people whom I used to command  sing like lamentation

Sumuqan had not yet come out in the dry land 
The humans of that distant time 
They did not know that food was to be eaten 
They were drinking water in the ditches 
At that time at the place of forming features of the gods 
In their temple on the Holy Mound  was creating lahar and Ezina 
The abundance of lahar and Anan 
Were eating but none among them were able to be filled 
The milkcream of their holy sheepfold the sweet thing the Anuna gods of the Holy Mound were drinking but none among them were able to be filled 
At that time Enki spoke to Enlil 
Becauseafter created them on the Holy Mound 
They were sending down both lahar and Ezina from the Holy Mound 
They were enclosing lahar in her sheepfold 
They were giving vast vegetation to her 
For Ezina they were putting down a fertile field 
They were giving to her the plow the yoke and its plow team 
After the shepherd furnished her with allure in the sheepfold 
After Ezina stood in the furrow 
She was a beautifulverdant young woman bearing allure 
After she raised her fertile head in the field 
In heaven abundance was there for them 
In the land life force was there for them 
They were properly executing the me of the gods 
They were making things proliferate in the storehouse of the land 
Into the prison founded in the dust 
They are the ones who increase things in the house heavily 
Where they stand they are correct where they sit they are appropriate 
They are ones that are pleasant in the heart of An and the heart of Enlil

In those days in those distant days 
in those nights in those remote nights 
in those years in those distant years 
in days of yore when the necessary things had been brought into manifest existence 
when the ovens of the Land had been made to work 
when the heavens had been separated from the earth 
when the earth had been delimited from the heavens 
when the fame of mankind had been established 
when An had taken the heavens for himself 
when Enlil had taken the earth for himself 
when the nether world had been given to Erekigal as a gift 
when he set sail when he set sail 
against the king a storm of small hailstones arose 
against Enki a storm of large hailstones arose 
The small ones were light hammers 
the large ones were like stones from catapults  
The keel of Enkis little boat 
as if it were being butted by turtles was trembling 
like wolves were eating together 
against Enki the waves at the stern of the boat 
like a lion were attacking 
At that time there was a single tree a single alub tree a single tree 
growing on the bank of the pure Euphrates 
being watered by the Euphrates 
and the Euphrates picked it up and carried it away 
respectful of Enlils words was walking along 
into Inannas luxuriant garden brought it 
The woman planted the tree not with her hands but with her feet 
The woman planted the tree not with her hands but with her feet planted it 
When will this be a luxuriant chair on which I can take a seat she said 
When this will be a luxuriant bed on which I can lie down she said 
5 years 1 years went by 
the tree grew massive its bark however did not split 
In its branches the Anzud bird settled its young 
In its trunk the phantom maid built herself a dwelling 
the maid who laughs with a joyful heart 
But silver Inanna cried 
When dawn was breaking when the horizon became bright 
his sister silver Inanna 
to the young warrior Utu said 
My brother in those days when destiny was determined 
when abundance overflowed in the Land 
when An had taken the heavens for himself 
when Enlil had taken the earth for himself 
when the nether world had been given to Erekigala as a gift 
when he set sail when he set sail 
when the father set sail for the nether world 
against Enki a storm of large hailstones arose 
The keel of Enkis little boat was trembling 
as if it were being butted by turtles 
against the lord the waves at the bow of the boat 
like wolves together were eating 
against Enki the waves at the stern of the boat were attacking Enki like a lion 
like a lion were attacking 
At that time there was a single tree a single alub tree a single tree  
growing on the bank of the pure Euphrates 
being watered by the Euphrates 
The force of the south wind uprooted it and stripped its branches 
and the Euphrates picked it up and carried it away 
respectful of Enlils words was walking along 
and took the tree and brought it into Unug 
into silver Inannas luxuriant garden 
I Inanna planted the tree not with my hands but with my feet 
When will this be a luxuriant bed on which I can lie down she said 
5 years 1 years had gone by 
the tree had grown massive its bark however did not split 
At its roots a snake immune to incantations made itself a nest 
In its trunk the phantom maid built herself a dwelling 
the maid who laughs with a joyful heart 
But silver Inanna cried 
Her brother the young warrior Utu however did not stand by her in the matter 
When dawn was breaking when the horizon became bright 
when Utu had left his bedchamber 
his sister silver Inanna 
to the warrior Gilgame speaks 
My brother in those days when destiny was determined 
when abundance overflowed in the Land 
when Enlil had taken the earth for himself 
when the nether world had been given to Erekigala as a gift 
when he set sail when he set sail 
when Enki set sail for the nether world 
against the lord a storm of small hailstones arose 
The small ones were light hammers 
the large ones were like stones from catapults  
as if it were being butted by turtles was trembling 
against the lord the waves at the bow of the boat 
against Enki the waves at the stern of the boat 
like a lion were attacking 
At that time there was a single tree a single alub tree a single tree  
growing on the bank of the pure Euphrates 
being watered by the Euphrates 
and the Euphrates picked it up and carried it away 
I a woman respectful of Ans words was walking along 
respectful of Enlils words was walking along 
and took the tree and brought it into Unug 
The woman planted the tree not with her hands but with her feet 
When will this be a luxuriant chair on which I can take a seat she said 
When will this be a luxuriant bed on which I can lie down she said 
5 years 1 years had gone by 
At its roots a snake immune to incantations made itself a nest 
In its branches the Anzu bird settled its young 
In its trunk the phantom maid built herself a dwelling 
I silver Inanna cried 
her brother the warrior Gilgamesh stood by her 
to his waist his  belt of 5 minas weight he strapped 
5 minas were to him as 3 shekels 
His bronze axe used for expeditions 
which weighs 7 talents and 7 minas in his hand he took 
The Anzu bird living in its branches took up its young and went into the mountains 
The phantom maid living in its trunk left  her dwelling 
As for the tree he uprooted it and stripped its branches 
and the sons of his city who went with him 
He gave it to her for her bed 
As for himself from its roots he manufactured his ball  
and from its branches he manufactured his mallet  
and he praised himself in the broad square never wanting to stop praising himself 
The young men of his city were playing with the ball  
For  him who made the team of the widows children  
For those that had a mother bread for her son she brought 
As the evening came 
he marked the spot where the ball  had been placed 
and he picked up his ball  from in front of him and took it home 
But early in the morning as he  the place marked 
the widows accusation 
and the young girls complaint 
caused his ball  and his mallet  to fall down to the bottom of the nether world 
tried with his foot but could not reach them 
At the gate of Ganzer in front of the nether world he sat down 
O my ball  O my mallet  
My ball  I am still not satiated with its charms 
the game with it has not yet palled for me 
If only my ball  waited still in the carpenters house for me 
I would treat the carpenters wife like my own mother 
I would treat the carpenters child like my little sister 
My ball  has fallen down to the nether worldwho will retrieve it for me 
My mallet  has fallen down to Ganzerwho will retrieve it for me 
My king you weep why does your heart worry 
Today I shall retrieve your ball  from the nether world 
Gilgamesh answered Enkidu 
If today you are going to go down to the nether world 
Let me talk to you Pay attention to my words 
they would recognise immediately that you are alien 
You should not anoint yourself with fine oil from a bowl 
they would surround you at its scent 
You should not hurl throwsticks in the nether world 
the spirits would feel insulted by you 
You should not put sandals on your feet 
You should not shout in the nether world 
You should not kiss your beloved wife 
You should not hit your wife even if you are annoyed with her 
You should not kiss your beloved child 
You should not hit your son even if you are annoyed with him 
She who lies there she who lies there 
Ninazus mother who lies there 
her pure shoulders are not covered with a garment 
and no linen is spread over her pure breast 
She has fingers like a pickaxe 
she plucks her hair out like leeks 
Enkidu however did not heed not his masters words 
He put on his clean garments 
and they recognised that he was alien 
and they surrounded him at its scent 
He hurled throwsticks in the nether world 
and the spirits felt insulted by him 
He put sandals on his feet 
He caused irritation in the nether world 
He kissed his beloved wife 
and hit his wife when he was annoyed with her 
He kissed his beloved child 
The warrior Gilgamesh son of Ninsumun 
directed his steps on his own to Ekur the temple of Enlil 
He cried before Enlil 
The udug demon of Nergal who spares nobody did not seize him but the nether world has seized him 
He did not fall in battle on the field of manhood but the nether world has seized him 
Father Enki my ball  fell down into the nether world my mallet  fell down into Ganzer 
Namtar did not seize him the Asag did not seize him but the nether world has seized him 
The udug demon of Nergal who spares nobody did not seize him but the nether world has seized him 
He did not fall in battle on the field of manhood but the nether world has seized him 
Father Enki stood by him in this matter 
He said to the young warrior Utu the son born by Ningal 
and then bring up his servant from the nether world 
He opened a window in the nether world 
and brought up his servant with his breeze  from the nether world 
They hugged and kissed 
They wearied each other with questions 
Did you see the order of the nether world 
If only you would tell me my friend if only you would tell me 
If I tell you the order of the nether world 
si yourself down and weep I shall sit down and weep 
 which your heart rejoiced to touch 
is  
like  of  a crevice it is full of dust 
Alas he said and sat down in the dust 
Did you see him who had 1 son I saw him How does he fare 
He weeps bitterly at the wooden peg which was driven into his wall 
Did you see him who had 2 sons I saw him How does he fare 
He sits on 2 bricks eating bread 
Did you see him who had 3 sons I saw him How does he fare 
He drinks water from a saddle waterskin 
Did you see him who had 4 sons I saw him How does he fare 
His heart rejoices like a man who has four asses to yoke 
Did you see him who had 5 sons I saw him How does he fare 
He is a cheerful as a ploughman 
Did you see him who had 7 sons I saw him How does he fare 
As a companion of the gods he sits on a throne and listens to judgments 
Did you see the palace eunuch I saw him How does he fare 
Like a useless alala stick he is propped in a corner 
Did you see the woman who never gave birth I saw her How does she fare 
Like a  pot she is thrown away violently she gives no man joy 
Did you see the young man who never undressed his wife I saw him How does he fare 
You finish a rope and he weeps over the rope 
Did you see the young woman who never undressed her husband I saw her How does she fare 
You finish a reed mat and she weeps over the reed mat 
Did you see him who had no heir I saw him How does he fare 
Like him who  bricks  he eats bread 
Did you see  
Did you see  
His food is set apart his water is set apart he eats the food offered  to him he drinks the water offered  to him 
Did you see him who was eaten by a lion 
Did you see him who fell down from the roof 
They cannot  his bones 
Did you see the leprous man 
His father and mother are not there to hold his head and his wife weeps 
Did you see the spirit of him who has no funerary offerings I saw him How does he fare 
He eats the scraps and the crumbs  tossed out in the street 
Did you see him hit by a ships board How does he fare 
Did you see him hit by a ships board How does he fare 
Alas my mother the man cries to her 
he  cross beam  crumbs 
Did you see my little stillborn children who never knew existence I saw them How do they fare 
They play at a table of gold and silver laden with honey and ghee 
Did you see him who was set on fire I did not see him 
His spirit is not about His smoke went up to the sky

Holy Inanna did not know how to accept the nindaba offering anymore 
The matterword of the Ekur engendered dazed silence 
Trembling lingered for Inanna in Agade 
In Ulma Inanna was afraid 
She went out from the city into her original place of dwelling 
The young woman as if to abandon that of her womens quarters 
Holy Inanna abandoned the shrine of Agade 
Like a warrior advancing against the weapon 
She imposed battle and combat apart from the city 
She beat the breast for the enemy instead 
It was not before the elapse of five days it was not before the elapse of ten days 
The bindings of the enship the crown of kingship 
He bound his hands towards the Ekur temple 
He acted towards the giguna like it was worth a mere thirty gig 
Like a male thief who plunders a city 
He gathered upimposed great ladders for use against the temple 
As if to cutseparate it like the mountain range of lapis lazuli 
Although the temple was not inof the mountain of the cut juniper 
He brought great hazin axes towards it

The gakkul vat that puts us in a happy mood 
The lamsare vat that makes the stomach rejoice 
The ugurbala jar glory of the house 
The agub jar filling with beer 
All the beautiful vessels are ready on their pot stands  
May the stomach of your god be well disposed towards you 
Let the eye of the gakkul vat be our eye  
and let the stomach of the gakkul vat be our heart 
What makes your stomach feel wonderful in itself  
We are in a happy mood our stomachs are joyful 
and you have laid the foundations in peace and prosperity 
now may Ninkasi dwell with you  
She should transfer one to the other beer and wine for you  
Let the pouring of the sweet liquor resound pleasantly for you 
In the troughs of bur grass there is sweet beer  
I will have the cupbearers the boys and the brewers stand by 
As I spin around the lake of drinks 
while drinking beer in a blissful mood 
while drinking alcohol and feeling exhilarated 
with joy in the stomach and a contented liver 
my stomach is a heart stomach with joy 
The stomach of Inanna is happy once again 
the stomach of Inanna is happy once again

Zuzu the headmaster 
Zuzu the headmaster 
Sidu the scribe 
Adlub the steward 
Bansage the lamentationpriest and temple administrator 
Mullia the mayor 
and the herald are the witnesses 
After you speak to my king 
Horse of the mountain range with claws of an eagle 
Date palm grown in a pure place from which shining dates hang down 
After you repeat to him 
For Abaindasa the overseer of the arrayed troops 
he who by delighting his king pleases the heart of his king 
Your servant thus says 
I am powerful the soldier of my king 
Byof your word I shall be your rider 
When the boat is idle I prepare the oars 
When the water is standing still I can make it flow 
When the wind is still I prepare the grain 
When  I illuminate  
When the water is still I make it flow 
the sweet words copies   
But now as if I was planted like a tree in my forest I bend over as one who is dirty 
In my city I the one who wore a clean garment now wears a dirty garment 
As one who has washed with mud clods I caked dirt to serve as facial makeup 
An uumgal creature that kills has also left behind scraps 
After the reedbed is consumed by fire the ponds remain 
After Utu has consumed ghee has consumed cheese he touches the churn to make it more productive 
I have brought out my lifebreath take hold of my hand 
I am the child of a widow one who has not had anyone to inquire after him 
as for me when will the heart of ulgi my king be returned to its place on my behalf 
To my lord the bull with sparkling eyes a beard of lapislazuli sporting 
speak 
your utterances like the words of a god are irrevocable
your utterances like rain pouring from the skies are uncountable 
If my lord agrees
my fathers household let no one carry off 
my fathers household let no one take away 
May my lord know this 
Messenger messenger to my mother 
say 
what monkey says 
Ur is the city resplendent of Nanna 
 In Eridu the city abundant of Enki 
 indeed I behind the door of the house of the Chief Musician am sitting 
There being no fresh bread there being no fresh beer 
Its a flood 
At his command your weapon struck me evilly 
At his command your weapon struck me evilly 
At his command your weapon struck me evilly 
At his command your weapon struck me evilly 
At his command your weapon struck me evilly 
At his command your weapon struck me evilly 
As I let the divine plan go out of my hand this divine plan returned to the abzu 
This tablet of destinies returned to the abzu I was stripped of the divine powers 
Ninurta was stunned at these words of the Anzuchick 
Ninmena gave out a wail 
Father Enki in the abzu knew what had been said 
and drew near with him to Enkis place the abzu 
The Anzuchick returned Utaulu to the abzu 
The lord was delighted with the hero 
Lord Nudimmud honored him duly 
from now to eternity you will keep your foot placed on its neck 
May the great gods give your heroic strength its due 
May your father Enlil do whatever you command 
May Ninmena not fashion your equal  
May no one be as revered as you and no god extend an upraised hand before you 
Monthly may your house  regularly receive tributes in the shrine in the abzu 
May An  proclaim your name in the seat of honor 
Where he stood he darkened and yellowed like  a floodstorm  
He contemplated great deeds and inwardly he was rebellious 
He uttered a word which has no  
He told no one and inwardly did not  
The great lord Enki intuitively grasped the substance of the plan 
By the house the minister Isimud opposed Ninurta 
The hero Ninurta refused to come out 
Against Ninurta Enki fashioned a turtle from the clay of the abzu 
Against him he stationed the turtle at an opening at the gate of the abzu 
Enki talked to him near the place of the ambush 
and brought him to the place where the turtle was 
The turtle was able to grab Ninurtas tendon from behind 
The hero Ninurta managed to turn back its feet 
The turtle kept on gnawing his feet with its claws  
The great lord Enki said to him 
 who makes big claims 
I cut down I raise up 
You who set your sights on me like this 
what has your position seized for you how  
Where has your strength fled Where is your heroism 
My ugplanteater Enki whom shall I send to you 
Men will shake their heads in fear  whom shall I send to you 
That name is not Enki That name is Uguguthatdoesnotpour  
You who are death without mercy whom shall I send to you 
In those remote days when the fates were determined 
in a year when An brought about abundance 
and people broke through the earth like green plants  
then the lord of the abzu King Enki 
Enki the lord who determines the fates 
built up his temple entirely from silver and lapis lazuli 
Its silver and lapis lazuli were the shining daylight 
An artfully made bright crenellation rising out from the abzu 
He built the temple from precious metal decorated it with lapis lazuli 
and covered it abundantly with gold 
Its eaves roar like a bull 
he goes to the temple and speaks to it 
He goes to the brick building and addresses it 
Temple built from precious metal and lapis lazuli 
whose foundation pegs are driven into the abzu 
which has been cared for by the prince in the abzu 
Like the Tigris and the Euphrates it is mighty and aweinspiring  
Joy has been brought into Enkis abzu 
Your lock has no rival 
Your roof beams are the bull of heaven an artfully made bright headgear 
Your reedmats are like lapis lazuli decorating the roofbeams 
Your vault is a wild bull raising its horns 
Your door is a lion who seizes a man 
Abzu pure place which fulfils its purpose 
Eengura Your lord has directed his steps towards you 
Enki lord of the abzu 
has embellished your foundation pegs with cornelian 
He has adorned you with  and  lapis lazuli 
The temple of Enki is provisioned with silver wax  
your doorjamb is the silver locking bar of heaven 
Abzu pure place place where the fates are determined 
the lord of wisdom Lord Enki 
Nudimmud the lord of Eridu 
Your abgal priests let their hair down their backs 
Enkis beloved Eridu 
Eengura whose inside is full of abundance 
Abzu life of the Land beloved of Enki 
Eridu your shadow extends over the midst of the sea 
mighty aweinspiring river which terrifies the Land 
your cry like that of a mighty rising river 
reaches  King Enki 
To his silver house its goodness he sets 
the lyre the algar instrument the balag drum 
The  with a sweet sound 
resounded by themselves 
The silver algar instrument of Enki played for him on his own 
What Enki says is irrefutable 
 is well established  
This is what Isimud spoke to the brick building 
As it has been built as it has been built 
as Enki has raised Eridu up 
birds brood 
The suhur carp play among the honeyherbs 
Like the sea he is aweinspiring 
like a mighty river he instils fear 
His punting pole is Nirah 
his oars are the small reeds 
When Enki embarks the year will be full of abundance 
As he leaves the temple of Eridu 
the river gurgles  to its lord 
its sound is a calfs mooing the mooing of a good cow 
Enki had oxen slaughtered and had sheep offered there lavishly 
He directed his steps on his own to Nibru 
and entered the temple terrace the shrine of Nibru 
Enki reached for  the beer he reached for  the liquor 
He had liquor poured into big bronze containers 
and had emmerwheat beer pressed out  
In kukuru containers which make the beer good he mixed beermash 
By adding datesyrup to its taste  he made it strong 
He  its branmash 
In the shrine of Nibru Enki 
provided a meal for Enlil his father 
He seated An at the head of the table 
and seated Enlil next to An 
He seated Nintur in the place of honour 
and seated the Anuna gods at the adjacent places  
All of them were drinking and enjoying beer and liquor 
and started a competition drinking from the bronze vessels of Urasz 
After beer and liquor had been libated and enjoyed 
and after  from the house 
Enlil addressed the Anuna gods 
Great gods who are standing here 
Anuna who have lined up in the Ubszuunkena 
My son King Enki has built up the temple 
He has made Eridu rise up  from the ground like a mountain 
He has built it in a pleasant place 
in Eridu the pure place where no one is to enter 
a house which tunes the seven tigi drums properly and provides incantations 
where silver songs make all of the house a lovely place 
the shrine of the abzu the good destiny of Enki befitting the elaborate divine powers 
the temple of Eridu built with silver for all this 
Father Enki be praised

When I was to greatly flatterpray to the great gods 
My   apart from the nindaba offeringnigba gift I withheld nothing 
Asalluhi king of Babylon son of Ilurugu  
Daily that city was plotting against my city 
Its king was continually seeking after larsa malevolently 
As if I was not the shepherd of the land the food offerings were not  
The youth who stood near to me at night in a dream 
Stood at my head I became aware of its furious gaze 
 the one who drove out my aura seized me with illness 
 the one who drove out my aura seized me with illness 
 the one who drove out my aura seized me with illness 
My illness which established a darkness that cannot be illuminated no one could see it 
No doctor could see diagnose it no bandage could not cool it 
Like a small bird fleeing from before a falcon I fight for my life 
I before the Namtar demon  
I within the power of the Namtar demon lamenting  
Have mercy like

At its base a snake that was immune to incantations made a nest 
In its branches the Anzu bird placed its chick 
The demon maiden of the empty wind made a house in its middle 
His sister the one who spoke a word to him 
The little ones were hammerstoneshandsized stones 
The large ones were stones that made the reeds shake 
The keel of the little boat of Enki 
They are sparrows witches that lay witchcraft like eggs 
For the male they tie up the arms 
They perform magic against the man 
One of them brought murmuring into a beverage and the man drank it 
One of them passed a word through the water 
Wheat flour set apart for the gods 
For the afflicted man may hisher bonds be loosened 
May her bonds like the contents of a bisag basket be loosened 
As if subjected to gushing water may the food be torn apart 
Like  may it go out from  
Swearing

Magic everything involving the face which approached  
Like a  covering the land may it pour water onto another meadow 
The magic that has put tears in your eyes 
May it pasture like a sheep may it belch while ruminating 
After you cast the water of the art of the incantation priest on that man 
After you purify and cleanse that man 
After you clean him like a bowl used for ghee 
After you scrub him like a flask 
After you pass his hand towards Utu the foremost of the gods 
Like a bronze cup may he return him to the hand of his god 
May the good god of that man the good one be praised 
May he make a good word manifest in his mouthmay his mouth make a good word manifest

For the mother of Ninazu Erekigal the recumbent one 
Her holy chest is not spread over with linen 
Enkidu did not accept the words of his master 
He wore his cleanest garment 
And therefore they marked him as a stranger 
He anointed himself with sweet oil from a stone vessel 
They flocked around him because of its scent 
He struck the netherworld with a bowthrowstick 
Those who had been struck by a bowthrowstick flocked around him 
He put a willow stick in his hand 
Ghosts gathered up around him 
His put sandals on his feet 
He spoke aloud in the netherworld 
He kissed his beloved spouse 
Did you see the man who had one child How has he fared

Upon two bricks he is sitting he is eating food 
Did you see the man who had three children How has he fared 
He is to drink water from the waterskin of the saddle peg 
Did you see the man who had 4 children How has he fared 
Like a man who yokes 4 donkeys his heart is pleasedrejoicing

By the possessor of a truthful heart he been taught Sumerian 
The one who he  away from the assignment it was said 
The sheaf that was not threshed his  which did not fall off 
You should be beaten on account of the output of this daily assignment  
The outcry has not been a regular occurrence 
And the one who knows the scribal art better than you 
Why did you speak with empty praise 
You have offended him you have cursed him you have insulted him 
The master did everything 
And grew exceedingly angry saying do as you wish 
Because of the fact that the one who acted like you offended his big brother 
After chains were placed on his feet 
He was confined in the house and did not leave the scribal school for two months 
Now the sin has been released for you 
From this day onwards their faces have been incised

Bring up his servant from the netherworld 
The hero youth Utu the son given birth to be Ningal 
By means of his breeze Utus son a dream god he brought it an aspect of Enkidu out from the netherworld 
He was exhausting him with inquiries 
Would that you will speak to me would that you will speak to me 
You are someone that has seen the orders of the netherworld 
Would that you will speak to me would that you will speak to me 
Wise one you should not practice wisdom 
And I

After you are to go to the house of a man giving a drinking party for a god 
After you enter behind the man of the drinking party 
Your own self which is so drunk does not even know how to use a hand is denigrated 
You raise an afflicted hand in order to eat food 
Prowling about in that of the cooling day for the edge of the sunlight 
Idiot slave lying at the edge of the fire 
When you move your joints your appendages split apart your skinflesh 
Breaking into houses digging 
Why would you quarrel with me 
You are the one who has insulted but it is not there in my fleshskin ie does not linger 
You by contrast are a barbarian who has not known the rear ie impact of your words 
You are an uncouth one has not known anything 
You are one who does not abandon being a rogue 
Mentally blocked person you cannot take hold of words 
Screamer lying in the middle of the fire 
PrisonerOne who seizes from the basket of the temples the domain of its sagbur functionary is not valuable for him 
Squawker shouter the district is disturbed for ie because of you 
Defiler who has not known any dignity 
One struck upon the head you have not known the son of a man ie the status of a man 
Selfproclaimed hero stand and hold a tablet 
You count up the lines to be entered on the tablet and you do it too quickly Akk  makes  get lost you write and you have to erase from it because it was wrong 
You cannot read aloud from that which was written on the tablet ie you cant read your own handwriting 
You incise it too heavily your hand is pierced by the stylus 
For the purposes of counting out the proper number of textual lines it the tablet has not been made suitable in order to be written upon its appropriateness is nonexistent 
And yet you say if the tablet is too small ie short for me I will finish it quickly 
You are one who has forgotten where he stood ie started 
You are one whose place where he sat ie stopped is scattered about 
One who has quit from good sense one who shouts out of frustration because of his predicament 
Who was it that spoke to you 
Stand idiot in order to have an argument But you should not have an argument again

Gutium the people who destroy will break them 
We sent by hand to father Enki in the Abzu of Eridu

While standing in the night with our sleeplessness what will we forget ie leave behind 
Enki if your city is cursed it will be given to the enemy land 
Why do they diminish us in the status of being apart from Eridu 
Why do they destroy us in our state of not being touched with care like a date palm 
Why do they break us in our state of not being coated in bitumen like a new boat

One who humiliates insulting woman 
Slanderer head striker 
Speaker of hostility conversing in lies 
Continually giving houses but not dwelling in the house of a man 
And you really are among women 
Filling water and roiling waterroiling clear water milling flour 
She baked there she burned there 
She does not set that which she has created on its way 
You will reply to me 
Witness of idiocy 
An I want to follow of the wordspeech of humanity 
The one of collegiality the one who breaks words to pieces 
Her case is nonexistent and yet a garment has been worn 
Litigant who has approached the assembly the assembly  
She is confused she is shaking she is seeking aimlessly 
Litigant after you stand in  and  a word 
Pitfall hater you utter words 
She has had no limit her womanhood is unsuitable 
She cannot comb her wool she cannot spin thread with the spindle 
She cannot keep up with work entering and going out from the house are diminished 
When you stand in the street another abuses 
When you attempt to converse with praisequote a proverb it falls at the feet ie fails 
But after you turn away you are shameless   is laughing 
This is an insult that you make 
In a house where there is beer she is its trough 
In the house where there is soup she is its emerah jug 
In the house where there is food she is the chief cook 
The house whose hand is wet she asks after 
She acts neighborly towards its master 
She sweeps the house she adornssprinkles it 
She is issuing orders and shouting 
She says to them Do not take anything everything that is here is mine 
And you  
The door of her house is a reed screen 
A millstone is her husband the pounding stone is her son 
Spouse of a slave consumer of that which is dragged 
Your house was built by a female slave and cared for by a male slave 
Saying I want to insult the words haven fallen out of the mouth 
I want to talk I want to kill  pig of the marshes dog one who is cut off

Because of you  touched the body 
You will say who are you giving orders to me

You are to loiter about in the square 
Go to the edubaa school it will be good for you 
By means of a humanity that does not know your body 
Your heartanger and your reputation going apart from my headlead  
In excess of the time that I stand over you 
No one should stand over their son 
Your beatings of ie during instruction in which nothing compares with you 
You behave like someone who does not know the rules in your understanding you a not a man 
Among my colleagues comparing with each man I conducted and no one who compares with you is present 
This is what I recite to you 
By it deafnessstupidity turns into wisdom 
By it wisdom is made from  inferiority 
It seizes the snake as if using incantationsmurmuring 
I have become weary of always having to beat you and have let that form of punishment go 
If a scribe knewlearned only one line of text 
He is a scribe 
If a singer knewlearned only one songhymn 
And his lamentvocalization was nevertheless good 
 the provider ie the king  
 the provider  
Its standingserving  like a supreme ration  
At its great gate Enlil stood the door open in the wind 
In Ur no one went towards food no one went towards water 
The people were circling around like water poured into a wellpond 
Enlil made starvation in the form of an evil person dwell in the city 
He made that which destroys cities that which destroys temples dwell in the city 
He made that which before it a weapon does not stand against dwell in the city 
He made the hungryunsatfisfied and the eyeroller dwell in the city 
In Ur even the feardisdain of head shaking like a single planted reed was not established 
Its people took refuge like a caught fish 
The king was mounted atop the gate tower there was no food there for him 
The king who had ate and drank good things had to now clutch at a mere ration 
The sun was clouded over one was being enviouswatching and knew fasting 
His supreme storehouse was not filled with grain no one could take refuge there 
The grain goddess was not present in the large and small grain heaps 
The afternoon meal of the gods was not eaten funerary offerings  
In the great banquet the honeyed liquor and  wine ceased 
In the great oven the oxen and sheep were not being prepared ie roasted one could no longer smell it 
The temple that had once belowed like a bull  silently 
 did not execute deliveries properly  
The millstone the mortar and the pestle sat idle no one bends down towards them 
In the lapis harbor of Nanna boats were bound in the water due to silt 
The  rushes grew the  rushes grew the reed of mourning grew 
Boats and barges quit the shining harbor 
like  his angry heart  
 do not  my  
 as one who should not imposecast my  my darkness 
 grasping a barbers razor during that night and day shall not  
 its hair not hanging a bitterpainful mouthword  
 like a child eating too much do not  my colon  
 my slander was not there my king  
 overwhelming distress  on my backin my liver 
 I am a juniorchild the one who does not  
 look for me at its goodbeautiful forehead ie smile  
 my king lying down like a bull 
Like a great meadow in which the carp flood expands 
The flooded field did not produce fish after the water drained 
The irrigated orchard did not produce syrup and wine 
The seven balag drums were set on the ground like the standing horizon 
The ub and em drums resounding like Ikur  played in its midst 
He actively diminished your giguna and therefore should be madebound like Nibru 
The scribe that has not known Sumerian 
In conversing in ittranslating it 
At what time should he succeed 
You behave as if the regulations have never been taught 
In your  you are not a man 
This is what I recite to you 
By it deafnessstupidity turns into wisdom 
It seizes the snake as if using incantationsmurmuring 
I have become weary of always having to beat you and have let that form of punishment go 
Bringing about reconciliation by means of lies I will not consent to you on this 
After I fill my heart and it overflows therefore I scorn you 
On your own behalf you have not ceased your wailing 
But I have set aside your wailing 
Because of the contentintent of what you are to speak 
In order to go away from according to my words here 
I am going away from here according to my words 
My heart is carried away by an evil wind 
You cannot pay attention to your humanity  
Because of what I am I did not send you as one charged with the task to carry reeds from the reed bed 
Because of what you are you have not carried them 
In no wayat no time have I said Stand at the rear of an ox 
I did not send you as one charged with the task to follow the ox 
Come After you do the work eat food 
Because of who you are you have not done the task but you did eat the food 
When a person like you does a task 
If you observe the  of my colleagues 
Like ie each one of them ten gur of barley apiece they fill at the outsetper head 
Even the tiny ones the slave of their fathers 
Ten gur of barley apiece they place at the head ie provide 
As a man they exceed you 
You are not a man like each one of them 
Exceeding you they do not compare with you in the performance of assigned tasks 
Like them  
After it killed Kish like the bull of heaven 
After it slew the temple of Uruk in the dust like a great bull 
Where at that time to Sargon the king of Agade 
After Enlil gave the enship and kingship to him 
May distress fall upon your palace which was built for rejoicing 
May the evildoer shout continually in the  plain 
 had grown thickened his neck a time that was not appointed  
A form as if cast from a mold the statue the beautiful thing  
The one who is speckledfaced like a bison a time that was not appointed  
My beardedness that of my beautiful formstatue a time that was not appointed  
 did not act like a juvenile did not sin  
What did  do  
Enlil made starvation in the form of an evil person dwell in the city 
Enlil made starvation in the form of an evil person dwell in the city 
He made that which destroys cities that which destroys temples dwell in the city 
He made that which before it a weapon does not stand against dwell in the city 
He made the hungrydissatisfied and the eyeroller dwell in the city 
In Ur even the feardisdain of head shaking like a single planted reed was not established 
Its people took refuge like a fish living in a wellpond 
Meager and great alike spread out no one arosewas mustered 
The king mounted atop the gate tower there was no food there for him 
The king who had ate and drank good things had to now clutch at a mere ration 
There was no food for him in his palace it was not suitable for dwelling 
His supreme storehouse was not filled with grain no one could take refuge there 
The grain goddess was not present in the large and small grain heaps 
The afternoon meal of the gods was actively diminished there 
In the great banquet the honeyed liquor ceased 
As for the giriPAa knife that consumes oxen and sheep it lay abandoned in the plants 
The crybreath of the purearmed bursag buildingfunctionary stopped 
The temple that had once belowed like a bull  silently 
The deposit of the properly executed deliveries was a distant memory 
The millstone the mortar and the pestle sat idle no one bends down towards them 
In the lapis harbor of Nanna boats were bound in the water due to silt 
The water of the prow did not scream it did not cast joy 
Sand was piled up in the unuRIbanda buildingshrine of Nanna 
The  rushes grew the  rushes grew the reed of mourning grew 
In your canal that was made suitable for barges no one was rowing anymore 
The plans of the festival at the place of rites was changed 
The nesag offering ships of his birth father Enlil no longer brought the nesag offering 
 could not bring its nindaba offerings to Nibru for him 
The fence of the broad cattle pen of Nanna was torn apart 
The reed fence of the orchard was   established a breach 
The cow was seized along with its calf 
The munzer fed cows took to a strange path in an unknown part of the plain 
unidug the one who stores butter and cheese did not store butter and cheese 
People who did not know butter were churning its butter 
People who did not know milk were  its milk 
Suen wept to his father Enlil 
My birth father my city was  for youhim why did you turn away from me 
Enlil my Ur was  for youhim why did you turn away from me 
The nesag offering ships of his birth father no longer brought the nesag offering for him 
The winds carried off the en priestess of the outer city and the en priestess of the inner city 
The Kiur shrine the place of relaxation of Enlil has been made into a windblown shrine 
Enlil  your eye at your city it is an empty wasteland 
The dogs of Ur are not sniffing at the base of the city wall 
The one who burrowsdemarcates wells is not gathering earth at the market price 
My birth father turn around my city back to your arms from its loneliness 
Turn around my Ekinugal temple back to your arms from its loneliness 
So that my Ur is brought out so that the people are broadened 
So that he returns the me of Sumer which were destroyed to their place 
It is the 3rd kirugu 
Alas the true temple the true temple its man its man

And you fear your overseer 
Your overseer will love you 
If the objective is to be achieved when you speak to your companion 
Do not denigrate your colleagues 
If you are going because the day is about to arrive 
How long shall I stay 
I knowuntil my master has left 
Because of what I am I did not send you as one charged with the task to carry reeds from the reed bed 
The olddead reeds which even the tiny and little children carry 
Because of what you are you have not carried them 
In no wayat no time have I said Stand at the rear of an ox 
Regarding my ox I did not send you as one charged with the task to follow it 
Regarding my field I did not send you as one charged with the task to hoe it 
Regarding my field I did not send you as one charged with the task to sowcultivate it 
Come After you do the work eat food 
Because of who I am I have not spoken to you about this 
Because of who you are you have not done the task but you did eat the food 
If you observe the  of my colleagues 
They place at the head ie provide 
Even the tiny ones the slave of their fathers ten gur of barley apiece they place at the head ie provide 
As a man I exceed you 
You are not a man like each one of them 
My son their fathers 
My inferior like them 
They do not compare with you in the performance of assigned tasks 
Excessive is my exertion for you 
Who is it that has exerted himself for his son more that I 
My words which I recite to you are as follows 
It has not previously been the case Have fear It has not previously been the case Have shame 
 your comrade your friend you do not observe them 
It has not previously been the case Now assimilate with your big brothers 
It has not previously been the case Now assimilate with your little brothers 
From the ranks of skilled humanity that resides in the land 
Come Enki himself has discovered that nothing that has a name among them 
Nothing that could be named except for the art of the musician 
Like the shores of the sea where one shore is separated far away from the other 
You can be idle for eternity 
Greatly your that which is released has been enlarged 
Because your  reputation has not been smitten 
Because your reputation has not been beaten into the dust 
What now to do 
What now to do 
That which I did was not  
Its stolen rushes  carried away the rushes  
Its stolen rushes  carried away the rushes  
Its stolen rushes  carried away the rushes  
 turned away from  and was not saying my spouse 
The one of the true templeproductive estate abandoned his temple and was not saying my temple 
The rich person took a different path away from his possessions 
 the hero  
The one that is saying  my city 
Kazallu the city that teemed by itself was confused 
Numuda took a different path away from his city his beloved dwelling 
The watered orchards were baked like an oven the plain was dispersed 
 The city that Enlil did not inquire  after 
The city that An frowned at 
The city that Nudimmud who was angry at 
The city that  fashioned a bitter fate  for 
The city in which the slave raises weapons against 
The city that the enemy did not quit the weapon against 
The city that  will say its young woman does not rejoice 
The city that  will say its young man does not rejoice 
The city whose trees and reeds are sick 
The city that  destroyed in battle 
The city that the slave beat the chest against in battle ie revolted 
The city that the spouse abandoned that the son abandoned 
The deity of the temple  was not suitable for hisher temple anymore 
Heshe did not retain hisher possessions 
Its dogs laid down among the corpses instead of devouring them 
The  birds were eating the corpses 
The men of the rear died at the stern 
In the outside of the city  destroyed the outside of the city 
In the harbor of my city  killed  
 bent over ie died 
 bent over ie died 
A  of clay will not be able to cross the river himself 
A  of clay will not be able to cross the river himself

Enlil was replying to his son Suen 
In the  of of the windswept city the reed of mourning grows in lamentation 
In the  the reed of mourning grows in lamentation 
My son if you yourself are a native son then it is you who is the one whose tears they are 
Nanna if you yourself are a native son then it is you who is the one whose tears they are 
There is no revocation of a final verdict the word of the assembly 
If Ur was given kingship  did not give an eternal term of office 
From the distant day when the land was founded to the current limit of teeming people 
In order to lengthen the term of kingship in order to take counsel to that effect 
My Nanna do not become exhausted doing this leave your city 
At that time my king the native son quitkilled his liverlungs 
Lord Dilimbabbar fashioned a destroyedevil heart 
Nanna who loved his city left his city 
Ningal in order to go as a stranger of her city to a strange place 
In Ur fire that  by itself was extinguished 
A lament was competing with the wall up to its circuit in terms of completeness 
In Ur great hazin axes were sharpened before it 
Barbed arrows filled its outside like a rainstorm 
Great stones made a thudding pudpad noise by themselves 
The enemy defeated the people those who stood among the weapons 
In the city the ones who did not advance against the weapons dwelledsat in hunger 
Starvation thus filled the city it was not ceasing 
In hunger they were bowing their heads and twisting their muscles 
Its people filled the ponds they were  
Its king breathed painfully in his own house 
Alas what is it that we will say what is it that we will add 
The inside of Ur is death the outside is death 
How long until we are to be finished among the weapons of Elam outside the city 
The enemy stands in Ur we must come to an end 
Acting on behalf of their life and their back they spoke together 
They opened the bolt of the gate the storm was making its door stand in the street 
Elam set foot there like a great onrushing flood 
In Ur they were crushing their heads with weapons like a porous pot 
They could not sprint away as fugitives they were seized within the walls limits 
Like fish living in a pond they were seeking refuge 
The enemy dwelled in the Ekinugal temple of Nanna 
They were breaking the holy having heavy possessions bird 
They cut down the statue that occupied the uzga shrine 
Nineigara the supreme steward abandoned the storehouse 
They seized the great cows atby their  horns  cut their horns off 
 smote goring bulls with the weapon like they were grazing sheep 
The date palm of like strong copper the arm of heroism 
It was torn out like a rush it was cut like a rush it was turned sideways in its roots 
Its top was lodged in the ground a person to raise it was not available 
 trimmed its midribs and set its top on fire 
 its spadix with ripe dates  the well 
As for your colleagues their fathers do not dispatch their childrenjuniors charged with a task 
Excessive is my exertion for you 
But that which I observeddisapproved of has not been present 
My words which I recite to you are as follows it has not previously been the case Have fear It has not previously been the case Have pride 
Your companion with whom you both are standing in the same yoke 
Because you do not observe him that is why you cannot assimilate with him 
From the ranks of skilled humanity that resides in the land 
Enki named among everything that has been named the assigned task of the scribal art as the most painstaking 
Why  the scribal art  
Nothing named that could be named except for the art of the musician 
Thus the content of the art of the musician is esoteric 
You do not pay attention to my pointed remarks 
The fate of man decreed by Enlil  
That the assigned task of his father follows the son 
In no wayat no time has the formula lesson been listened to by you 
As one who speaks of the meager things he created 
Saying One should not pain themselves by fixing the eyes ie studying intently 
Saying I sought the place of my father 
Because of you I cannot sleep well either at night or at the midday 
My sternum separates for you 
I spend the night time  
Thinkingspeaking of great things you are excessive 
You are thick 
You are nervous from excitement you are growingboasting you are thin you are  
Because you do not observe your fellow man you think that they delight over you 
If your are at the site of a derision contest 
You assigned task now is jumping around 
This is your befitting role 
Now regarding that which you are able to assimilate withyou are to do to assimilate with me 
After I shall to speak to you about it 
Its throne was covered over from the front she could only sit in the dust instead 
They seized the great cows atby their  horns  cut their horns off

The date palm of like strong copper the arm of heroism 
Its top was lodged in the ground it did not have a person to raise it

In the temple its gebur ormanment fell its parapet was destroyed 
Its  embracing on its right and left 
Like smitten heroes they were covered from the front 
Its great stormdemon with an open mouth and the face of an awebearing pirig creature 
The enemy territory brought away the one felled with a saman rope like a caught wild bull 
The scent of the dwelling of holy Nanna which was like a juniper forest was brought to an end 
And the awe of the temple which had been goodthe awe was now destroyed 
The one that filled the lands like sunlight was rebuilt like the evening in heaven instead

My birth father my city was  for him why did you turn away from me 
Enlil my Ur was  for him why did you turn away from me 
My Ekinugal temple was  for him why did you turn away from me 
The nesag offering ships of my birth father no longer brought the nesag offering for him 
 could not bring its nindaba offerings to Enlil ofat Nibru for him 
The winds carried off the en priestess of the outer city and the en priestess of the inner city 
Ur like a city struck by a pickax has been broken up into ruin heaps 
Greatly your that which is released has been enlarged 
Because your  reputation has not been smitten 
Because your reputation has not been made to touch the dust 
Because of what has been destroyed I will recite to you the following 
What now to do 
You have not learned from the deeds which I have done 
Afflicted person wind man idiot possessing  hands and feet  sorcery 
Wind man idiot thief who breaks into houses 
Barbarian ecstatic 
Possessing lips spewing scraps that make things painful 
Head dragger cripple 
Possessing a scent that induces vomiting an evil stench 
Stinking like fetid butter one who stinks 
Possessor of a scent that induces vomiting defiling and destroying 
Dog with its head pressed to the ground who is sniffing 
Dog with its head pressed to the ground who is sniffing 
Possessing a head that is not good for its mouth an evil head 
Donkey that eats its own bedding 
Wearer of only a loincloth laying down on the oven 
One who drops thingsfalls into a well dropped by the demon lugaluraBlrim ie an attack of epilepsy

Inappropriate person  denouncerinformer 
Until one and as whom will you go like this The one who insults you 
May the one who insults you be 36 doubleleagues away from your person 
May your curser be 36 doubleleagues away from your person 
So that your fellow man raises your neck and chest 
And your city the good place invokes your name 
And your god names you with a good name a true word 
Be pleasing in the eye of Nanna your god 
Enki king of  
Asalluhi citizen of Eridu  
May  be holy like heaven may  be pure like earth 
rushes for his bedding

The gizi reeds that grew in the holy enclosure were actively diminished 
In the temple its gebur ormanment fell its parapet was destroyed 
 embracing on its right and left 
Like smitten heroes they were covered from the front 
 were felling them with a saman rope like a caught wild bull enemy territory  
And the awe of the temple which had been goodthe awe was now destroyed 
Its door the one that  sunlight like a beautifulverdant star of heavenconstellation 
And the great boundary stakes shouted so that  would not tear them out 
Its hinge  was defiled with a stunned silence 
The noise of the previously fixedcontrolled door fell silent it had no one to fixcontrol it 
 was actively diminished it set  in the broad street 
In the royal offering place the nindaba offering of the royal offering place was changed 
In its holy  was not making the tigi em and ala drums sound nobly 
Among its supreme tigi drums the aua functionary did not sing pure songs 
The throne where cases had been decided no longer stood cases were not undertaken correctly 
In the holy bed chamber of Nanna  shall not  at his feet 
The holy treasure box which no one is to see the enemy saw inside of it 
 did not set up the pure bedbed of flowers  did not spread out shining plants upon it 
They were cutting down the statue that occupied the uzga shrine 
The dream interpreter the engiz temple cook and the seal bearer did not use the eda vessel properly 
They stood in the manner of one whose neck is pushed to the ground the enemies took them away 
Suen brought his  there for his father 
He knelt there before his birth father Enlil 
On my hair bound up with the suh headresspectoral 
The great cleaned pure day has become dirty  
Examine faithfully your heart darkened by anger which terrifies like a wave 
The destroyed city the flattening of the parapet of the great wall by the storm this too is a part of the turn of office 
Previous dweller in your dwelling the Etemenniguru temple which was built faithfully 
May  rebuild it  may the people bow down towards it 
May  have bread  at its base may Anan dwell with it 
May there be joy in its branches may Utu rejoice with him 
May Ur the city decreed by An be returned to its place for you 
May Enlil like a true speaker raise his neck towards heaven 
For Nanna may the high and low land assemble 
For Suen may he set the roads of the land of land in order 
With a noise like a rainstorm touching the earth may pounding stones be employed for him 
It was the spoken word of An and Enlil and therefore it was being carried out faithfully 
Father Nanna stood in his city Ur with head held high 
The youth Suen was able to enter into his Ekinugal temple 
He was able to enter into Ur into his Ekinugal temple 
It is the 4th kirugu

In its midst the reed of lamentation grew in lament 
It is its gegigal response 
Month Harvest 18th day

Its ravens are eating the corpses 
The men of the front died at the bow of the boat 
In the middle of the city  destroyed the middle of the city 
In the outside of the city  destroyed the outside of the city

Therefore when they have ordered my city to be destroyed 
When they have ordered Urim to be destroyed 
When they have ordered its people to be killed

That which issues from the mouth of Enlil is not to be changed 
It is the 4th kirugu 
To the detriment of the lady her city is destroyed 
Her city is destroyed to her detriment her cosmic powers are changed to her detriment 
It is the gegigal response 
Enlil spoke to the storm and the people wailed 
He commanded the malevolent storm and the people wailed 
He spoke to the storm annihilating the land and the people wailed 
He spoke to the great storm the one of An and the people wailed 
He spoke to the great storm of An and the people wailed 
The great storm was shouting from above and the people wailed 
The storm annihilating the land roared upon the earth 
An evil wind overflowing like a great flood which does set down its powerwing 
In the city the weapon was murdering and consuming as if in a pack 
At the base of heaven the storm gnawed and the people wailed 
The storm was burning with fire at its front and the people wailed 
Noon which usually raises the rainy wind fog was burning with fire instead 
Midday which usually brings out bright sunlight brought darkness along with it 
The shining sun did not come out in the land it dissipated like the evening 
The southern wind seized the joyful night which initiates the cooling of water 
The storm blew a wind upon the blackheaded people and the people wailed 
Sumer was tripping as if in a gebur snare and the people wailed 
The people were erecting a wall of heads the storm devouring as if in a pack 
The bitter storm for which weeping was not decreed as its fate because of this the people wailed

The storm made a breach in the wall and the people wailed 
At the great gate where there was a path it was piling up corpses 
In the broad lane prepared as if for a festival heads were placed as seeds 
In the playground where there was a festival it spread out people as sheaves 
Ditchesburial pits were put down for the blood of land like it would be done for the drainpipe of heaven 
That of the corpses like sheep fat in sunlight dissolved by themselves 
Like a goat buck caught by a snare one lodged his mouth in the dirt 
And therefore like a man ended by the mitum weapon one did not bother to wear bandages 
As if lying in the birthing place of their mother one laid in his blood 
Those who had not drunk wine nonetheless hung their necks down lit on the shoulder 
Those who served with weaponry were slaughtered by weaponry 
The storm took away fugitive men and gazelles alike and the people wailed 
The elder women and men who did not leave the house were set on fire 
Water brought away the tiny ones  from the lap of the mother like fish 
The strong grasp of the wetnurse this grasp was loosened 
Allegiancesense was forgotten and the people wailed 
The treasury of the land was eradicated and the people wailed 
Possessed of everything and anything of the cosmic powers

In ancient time in the time that good fate was decreed 
An and Enlil established the plans of the universe 
The Tigris and Euphrates having been excavated on the edge brought water into the lands 
He dredged the small canals the ditches were established there 
 Enki broadened the cattle pen and sheepfold he made them acquire a shepherd and cow herder 
Enki knotted the marshes together he made the old reed growth and fresh reed stalks grow 
In the plain he gave the means of eating and drinking to living creatures 
Nudimmud the supreme prince the lord of broad wisdom 
After he created both the fish and the bird 
He filled the marsh and reedbed with them 
He chose their station on behalf of you  
He made their eyes discover their design 
The bird founded a nest at the intake of the reed bed 
The bird terrified the fish in the deep watermarsh by means of its scream 
The fish stood he was shouting to the bird 
It was boasting by means of a fight he intiated a quarrel 
At that time the fish was speaking to the bird in the deep watermarsh with an outcry 
Bird releasing ie uninhibited shouting  was not presentplaced 
Spending time eating way too much having horrible diarrhea 
In the furrow the members of the ranks of farmers should not cease  a net for you 
The gardener should not cease setting up a net in the irrigated orchard for you 
You are one who is destroying thingsfood in the garden you are one who cannot sweeten the flesh of the land 
Your feet are not good for fields that have wet patches 
The young sweeper who is sweeping in the temple is braiding a malevolent rope there for you 
The palace is confused by your scream it is to be abandoned by the agency of your mouth 
They bring one of your kind into the fatteners shed 
They pour cold water into the watering trough for you 
The fowler delivers one of your kind with bound wings 
The fisherman brings one of your kind into the palace 
They cripple your wingsfeathers and faceeyes 
Your shouting has no limit what is your flying 
By means of your horrible cry you frighten the night one does not sleep well 
Bird leave the marsh remove your scream from above me 
Bring out a pit in the sand dunes thus is what is appropriate for you 
At that time the fish insulted the bird 
Because of its beauty the bird knew about its multicolored back and multicolored face 
It was as if a nursemaid was singing a lullaby 
It was not heeding these words laughing malevolently instead 
At that time the bird was replying to the fish 
Thus your heart produces exuberance you have actually humilated yourself 
Possessor of blunted limbs and blunted appendages turn your neck by means of the fins 
Possessor of a smell that is not good inducing vomiting opening the mouth and wrinkling of the nose 
No one holdscatches your eating ie food properly with a caulked container or a cord 
Your plunderer does not touch his hand to his skin

Your plunderer does not touch his hand to his skin 
In the great swamp in the broad marsh I am your ranger 
One cannot eat its good food because of me my voice approaches there 
From among your little ones you might as well pile up for me as a regular offering for my sustenance  
Your large ones are indeed the solution of the site of a banquet 
I am the beautiful and knowledgable bird 
But there is no one who has prepared the working of your pure waxmold 
In the courtyard my noise is a fitting thing one established it as suchset it apart 
My cry is that of a sweet thing 
Fruits of the orchard are for my many regular offerings 
babaza porridge malt hulled grain and emmer flour are for my thingsfood that sweetens the mouth 
Thus you do not know my greatness Bow your neck to the ground 
At that time the bird insulted the fish 
The fish possessed of anger trusting in the heroic might of the deep water 
Whatever insults the bird had struck it with it did not ponder 
It was able to set its neck on the ground sarcastically it was speaking freelyhumbly 
For the 2nd time the fish replied to the bird 
Bird you do not know my greatness you did not tread behind me you are one who has not inquired after me 
You cannot know either my weakness or my strength you have spoken an inflammatory word 
Possessor of trimmed limbs crippled feet a  mouthbeak and a thinned outflattened tongue 
By means of ignorance you have been able to sneershoutchew but you have not advised yourself 
I the fish am the one who piles up the abundance of the pure shrinesea together 
I am the one who bringsgoesstands among the great nindaba offerings of the Ekur proudly 
Like the grain goddess Ezina I am here for the sustenance of the land I am her helper 
Bird what is your great thing that you accomplished I will make you known your over exuberance 
I want to return back into your mind your arrogance and mendacious speech 
Silently and deceptively it went on its arms 
When the bird got up from its nest in order to bring back food for its chick 
The fish sought the place silently 
It struck the birds established nest its prepared plants making it a windswept shrine 
It killed its eggs and its nest with water it covered them in the sea 
For a 2nd time the fish insulted the bird 
At that time the bird with the face of a pirig creature and the claws of a hurin bird 
It was beating its wings towards its nest but its flight path was blocked 
With its mouth it was screaming in the midst of heaven like the nugig midwife of heaven ie Inanna 
At that time the bird which was looking carefully its limbs were spread out 
Like a stormwind that is to shake to the midst of heaven it roamed in heaven 
The bird was searching the fish in the deep water it sought it in the marshes 
The bird saw the fish in the deep water and planned against it 
It seized it it tried to flee in the water but the bird held it with its claws 
It heaped up its little spawn together it heaped them in the manner of sheaves 
The bird took out revenge but its heart was not cooling 
For a 2nd time the bird was replying to the fish 
Clever one inferior one deaf one with muddled plans fish you should not come out 
Roaming the harbor its mouth not eating a storm blowing away fodder 
Guard who dwells in a boundup house slithering by itself 
Out of ignorance it got angry it spattered its hands in blood 
I am the one who flies in heaven I am the one who goes about on earth 
Wherever I am going whatever is its name I am the happiness that is present on behalf of

It was able to submit furiously it was speaking freelyhumbly

Eating way too much  filling the courtyard with feces

Hero ugal net that overwhelms the enemy 
Ninurta your aura and shade are stretched over the land 
When he occupied the throne upon the supreme dais when he bore a great aura 
When he initiated a festival when he rejoiced when he sat broadly 
When Ninurta the son of Enlil was to determine fate 
At that time the weapon of the lord looked at the mountain 
arur above on the one hand was speaking to the king 
Lord of heavenly station who occupies the dais in the assemblythrone room 
Ninurta you utterance never wavers your decreed fate is put faithfully in effect 
My king heaven mated with the verdant earth 
Ninurta it gave birth to a warrior that knows no fear the Asag 
One that did not sit as a child with a wetnurse who suckled milk by itselfsuckled fear as milk 
My king one that did not know the rearing of a father the slaughterer of the mountain 
Ninurta one that lifts itself and rejoices with its form 
My hero who is a bull I shall lean upon 
It procreated in the mountains it spread out its seed 
Together they shall name it the plants as their king 
In their midst like a great bull it raises its horn

My king this one has cast down a dais its slacked arm does not relent 
Ninurta lord it has decided its cases just like you 
Against the Asag against its aura who penetrates with their hand 
Who could set out against its great temples 
My lord the mountain has conveyed its nindaba offerings to that place 
Hero it has inquired about you because of your father your lineage 
It said Ninurta you shoulder singular warrior never idle 
It has ordered you because ofas  
Hero the intent to carry away your kingship is present in these queries 
Its ablebodied young men were chased away into captivityas corpses by themselves for you 
The city that has not compelled its people to say the landmountain is for you 
Nor has its people said your father  
Despite your holy word being spoken to them may that place back in its tracks 
Its woman will not say pleasant things with her husband 
Nor advise him at night 
Nor reveal the purity of her heart 
Aroused wild cow eldest child of Suen 
One who validates the cosmic powersrites great queen of queens 
One who emerged from the holy womb superior to her birth mother 
She is the wise discerning queen of the lands 
He has caused my utter destruction in a place of violence 
Dilimbabbar has not undertaken my case 
If he did what is to me If he did not what is it to me 
Victorious he Lugalane drove me out from the temple 
He makes me go in the  brambles of the mountain 
He removed the true crown of the en priestess from my head 
Most precious lady loved by An 
Most precious lady loved by An 
May your holy heart which is supreme be restored to its place for me 
Beloved spouse of Amauumgalana Dumuzi 
The Anuna have submitted to you 
Since birth you have been the younger sister of Utu 
And thus you have been superior to the Anuna the great gods 
My case has not been finalized but the threat of a hostile decision like my case lingers in my face 
The enemy and the evildoer have not escaped its grasp 
In the city that has been endowed with truth 
Which has made righteousness and justice into a treasure 
Where clean clothes are at the quay 
The older brother is to honor the younger brother and behave with humanity 
The son is to humbly revere his mother so that he endures until his old age 
It is at the holy city and settlement of Enlil 
It is at Nibru the beloved shrine of the Great Mountain 
And thus its  of abundance the temple  he raised 
Its ruler the Great Mountain father Enlil 
In the Ekur the supreme shrine he has sat on its dais 
No one can disperse the cosmic powers of that temple 
Its cosmic powers are the cosmic powers of the Abzu which no one is to see 
Its inside it a vast sea whose horizon is unknown 
On its platformretaining wall with sparkling standards 
Your Ekur the lapis temple supreme dwelling bearing an aura 
Its aura touches heaven 
And therefore its shade stretches over the lands 
The lords and rulers 
Brought the holy nindaba offerings there properly 
And  praysbeseeches him with ud prayers and siskur rites

The one you called to faithfully the one you elevated in the land 
The land to his hand the land to his feet 
You make the most distant place of the lands submit to him 
Accumulated like frost that which is all over the ground 
He brought in regularly into the treasury 
He conveyed nindaba offerings into the supreme courtyard 
He brought them into the Ekur in the manner of heaps 
He is the herder and leader of living things 
He made his great rulership manifest 
He made the pure crown and pectoral verdantbeautiful on his body 
In the Tumuhursag temple where he resides on the dais 
He shall lay across heaven like a rainbow 
He went by himself as a floating cloud 
He is the only ruler of heaven he is the uumgal creature of the earth 
And therefore he decrees his own fate

On account of your wearing the holy ba garment 
On account of your setting a hand straight away into heaven 
On account of your not bringing your nose close to the ground 
On account of your not dragging your beard in the dust 
They killed you and one of them stripped you naked 
Like an elephant one seized your tusks 
Like a great wild bull like a thick horned one  touched the ground  
Like a bull I cast down  towards your massive horns  founded hatred for you 
 filled your eyes with weeping 
 placed lamentation in your heart 
In is outskirts the bird of despair founded a nest 
A 2nd time she made a wishrejoiced at the furious aura she boasted faithfully 
He placed a weapon at my right arm 
At my left arm I  on a sealtablet 
My rage a harrow with large teeth tears apart the mountain

The male going on the road who otherwise spends the night on the road 
Therefore has taken refuge there as if it was his built city 
So that my name is established to distant time so that it is not dropped byfrom the mouth 
I am possessed of speed I muster up my strength I am  running 
From Nibru to the brickwork of Urim 
My heart therefore spoke to me in order to make a round trip as if it was only one doublehour 
A pirig creature not tiring by means of its youth I am one who stands in its strength 
My little niglam garment was suitable on my hips 
Therefore like a  wild dove flying furiously I pumped my arms 
Therefore like the Anzud bird raising its eye towards its mountain I spread my knees apart in stride 
Therefore the cities of the land that I founded served me 
Therefore my blackheaded people teeming like ewes look to me sweetly 
Like a goat of the mountain range that is to run to its dwelling 
As Utu broadening the daylight upon the settlements 
Therefore I was entering the Ekinugal temple 
Therefore bulls were slaughtered there sheep were slaughtered there 
Therefore the tigi drum the good thing was played properly there

When I roused myself from the  cultic area like a pirig creature 
Therefore the howling storm shook the ground 
Ikur shouted in the broad heavens 
Therefore the rain of heaven mingled with lit embraced the water below 
Therefore made a thud on my back 
I am a king who therefore could not be frightened or have gooseflesh 
Like a fierce pirig creature I therefore snarled 
Therefore as an equid of the plain I galloped 
When I ran as a perfect male donkey 
Utu was to look towards his house at sunset 
And thus I had made the round trip the journey being 15 doublehours 
My sagursag performers saw the feat 
My brother and friend who is the youth Utu

From Nibru to the brickwork of Urim 
Therefore my heart resolved to make the round trip as if the journey was one doublehour 
A pirig creature not tiring by means of its youth I am one who stands by itself 
My little niglam garment was suitable on my hips 
Like a  wild dove flying furiously I pumped my arms 
Therefore like the Anzud bird raising its eye towards its mountain I spread my knees apart in stride 
Therefore the cities of the land that I founded stood for me 
Therefore my blackheaded people teeming like ewes look to me sweetly 
Like a goat of the mountain range that is running to its dwelling

Therefore I was entering the Ekinugal temple 
Therefore the temple of Suen the cattlepen of great amounts of butter was filled with abundance 
Therefore bulls were slaughtered there sheep were slaughtered there 
Therefore the em and ala drums resounded 
Therefore the tigi drum the good thing functioned properly there 
I am Shulgi the one who makes anythingfood numerous and therefore I offered food offerings there 
Therefore I bend the knee there and ate food there 
Therefore I was arising like a harrier and a falcon 
Therefore I was returning towards Nibru in my exuberance 
At that time the storm therefore shouted the stormwind circled 
Therefore the north and south winds howled by themselves 
Therefore flashing lighting wreaked havoc in heaven together with the seven winds 
The beautiful Nanibgal Nisaba 
Gave wisdom and intelligence generously to me

When I rose as if possessing the musculature of a leopard 
When I galloped mightily like a nisku equid 
In my happiness Enlil spoke truthfully to me 
They gave me a scepter because of my justice 
I was able to step on the neck of the lands

After I go out into combat and battle 
To the place that Enil has grown angry at
