r.en: to Uruk towards the princely divine powers 
r.en: Sumer and Akkad marvel. 
r.en: Did he not he moor the boat at the quay of Kulaba? 
r.en: With a big wild bull of the mountains with uplifted horns 
r.en: with a sheep led by the hand of an en priest at his right side, 
r.en: with a reddish kid and a bearded kid doubled up on the breast, 
r.en: before Inanna in the shrine of E-anna he enters. 
r.en: Good shepherd Šulgi, loving heart, dressed himself in a ma garment, 
.en: put a ḫili wig as a crown on his head. 
.en: Inanna marveled, 
.en: and spontaneously struck up a song, 
.en: singing the lyrics: 
.en: “When for the king, for the lord, 
.en: I have bathed, 
.en: when for the shepherd Dumuzi I have bathed, 
.en: when I have adorned my sides with clay, 
.en: when with resin I have colored my nose, 
.en: when with kohl I have covered my face, 
.en: when with hands of his fairness, 
.en: he has covered my hips, 
.en: when the lord who lies down beside silver Inanna, 
.en: the shepherd Dumuzi, 
.en: (has said) ‘I would loosen that of the lap’, 
.en: when in my radiant arms he has grown calm, 
.en: when ... like choice beer 
.en: ... had touched, 
.en: when my lap-wool has ..., 
.en: my pa-wool he has played, 
.en: when he has put hand to my vulva, 
.en: when on my sweet stomach he has lain, 
.en: like his night boat ..., 
.en: like his thin boat he has finished, 
.en: when on the bed he has caressed me, 
.en: then the lord I shall caress, 
.en: I shall decree him a good destiny; 
.en: the good shepherd Šulgi I shall caress, 
.en: decree him a good destiny. 
.en: his thick arms I shall caress, 
.en: shepherdship of all lands 
.en: as his destiny I shall decree.” 
.en: The lady, the mountain-crystal of heaven, 
.en: delight of the black-headed, 
.en: youthful woman who excels her mother, 
.en: by her father granted divine powers, 
.en: Inanna, daughter of Suen, 
.en: for Šulgi, son of Ninsun, 
.en: decrees a destiny: 
.en: “Your ‘walking to the fore in battle’ am I! 
.en: Your ‘weapon carrier in combat like an attendant’ am I! 
.en: Your ‘advocate in the assembly’ am I! 
.en: Your ‘breath-giver in the campaign’ am I! 
.en: Shepherd chosen by ... silver are you! 
.en: King, good provider of Eanna are you. 
.en: carneol of An’s Irigal are you! 
.en: fir for running, 
.en: fit to lift head in the august dais are you! 
.en: fit to take a seat on the lapis throne, 
.en: your head fit to wear a colorful, 
.en: as to your body, fit to spread out a the fleece-garment, 
.en: fit for stomach-hanging of the garment of royalty, 
.en: fit to lift to the side the mitum-weapon, 
.en: fit to open knees with mace, 
.en: fit to send off straight the broad arrows, 
.en: fit for throwing stick and shield bound to the hips, 
.en: as to your hands, fit for silver staff, 
.en: as to your feet, fit for silver sandals, 
.en: You have knees! On the campaign, fit for running, 
.en: fit for playing, like a calf of lapis, on my silver breast; 
.en: May your loving stomach be lasting! 
.en: An has doned this for you, may he never alter it! 
.en: May Enlil, the decreer of fates, never change it!” 
.en: So did Inanna caress him. 
.en: He who knows the joyful heart of Ninegal 
.en: sheared a black kid 
.en: bathed a white kid; 
.en: wild bulls of the mountains by their noses tied up 
.en: —house of the august breeding bull roars— 
.en: up to the young man Utu into the temple E-babbar brings, 
.en: up to the young man Utu raising his radiant forehead, 
.en: For Šulgi, good shepherd of Sumer, he decress a fate: 
.en: “King, colorful words, sweet face, 
.en: mighty hero, born to be a lion, 
.en: young cow standing firm in its vigor, 
.en: valiant, unbound in his strength, 
.en: whose feet trample great mountains: 
.en: the heroes of the foreign lands you have brought down, 
.en: you have trampled upon all the thrones, 
.en: your name to the edge of heaven you have established. 
.en: Your king—to Ašimbabbar go in peace.” 
.en: And so at Enegir, city built in splendor, 
.en: did he not moor the boat? 
.en: “Seed placed by the prince in the silver womb, born on the bright mountain, 
.en: Ninazu, like a wild bull lowing in drink, 
.en: “... like date syrup, ghee ... 
en: “... like date syrup, ghee ... 
en: “... like date syrup, ghee ... 
en: “... like date syrup, ghee ... 
en: your are hero! Come down from the revolting lands ... 
en: King, the lord of prayers and supplications chooses you by heart; 
en: shepherd Šulgi, the lord of prayers and supplications chooses you by heart; 
en: Who sets a king given strength by Enlil? 
en: Who enters to your ...? 
en: Who exits to your ...? 
en: ... who knows your stomach should not desire your strength. 
en: Having desired ... battle with you 
en: what escapes your outstretched arms? 
en: When like the thunder bird you shriek, who stands before you? 
en: When like the storm you howl, 
en: the foreign lands, open reeds ablaze, mountains trembling like reeds, 
en: in the houses of the foreign lands watching, 
en: Tidnum well marveled. 
en: Like Utu, your terror radiates in battle. 
en: Like Nergal, your mace drools in death 
en: your lance reaches into the blood of the Land. 
en: The great door of the city are you, the great wall of the Land are you! 
en: A net piled up over heaven and earth are you, lead-jenny positioned with Sumer are you, 
en: May your ... call in abundance! 
en: May the words of Enlil, enormous things, create shade on your head! 
en: May the loving heart Inanna never abandon you!” 
en: After Ninazu had called ... blessings again and again, 
en: he let ewes goodly produce endless lambs, 
en: let jennies goodly produce endless kids, 
en: let white cows set up calves, 
en: then before Nanna in his E-temen-ni-guru he enters with them, 
en: head held high in the most fitting house of the the royal household, in its royal offering place, the silver place. 
en: His king Ašimbabbar casts a joyous glance at him, 
en: for Šulgi, the good shepherd of Sumer, decreed a fate: 
en: “Hero, lord, mighty one of the foreign lands, right arm of the Land, 
en: you have achieved victory for me, have carried out the commandeds. 
en: The houses of the rebel lands that I have cursed you have reduced to ruin mounds. 
en: May you never grow weary of perfecting the divine powers for me every month at new moon! 
en: Like Ašnan, may your name be as sweet in the mouth of the Land and in the mouths of all the countries! 
en: May silver Ningal, lady of the Enunna, like the wooden frame of a waterskin spread out her lap for you! 
en: Thus did Suen decree a good fate. 
en: In the Egal-maḫ of Ninegal, he took his seat on the silver throne. 
en: The Ištaran of Sumer, omniscient from the womb, 
en: renders the judgments of the Land in due order, 
en: makes decisions for the Land in due order 
en: lets no strong man wrong the weak, 
en: lets mother speak sweetly to her child 
en: lets child answer truthfully to his father. 
en: Sumer is filled with abundance, 
en: Ur prolonged in splendor, 
en: ... establishes. 
en: Because the king exulted in his triumph and let his might radiate, 
en: his heroism set well, 
en: made the rebellious lands bow, 
en: made our city Ur raise neck in prosperity; 
en: king, adorned with a face of colorful lapis, son of Enlil; 
en: lifting up head to heaven in broad crown, 
en: with An in his lofty place taking counsel, sitting with Uraš on a big throne, 
en: manth and passing days making the Land of Sumer and all the foreign lands play joyously— 
en: praise be to Lord Ašimbabbar! 
en: praise be to Nisaba!

.en: On Eninnu, whose ‘me’ is very large, 
.en: he (Ningirsu) directed his (Gudea’s) eye there.

.en: counseled about the message: 
.en: “Let me, let me tell it to her, let me, let me tell it to her, 
.en: may she stand by me in this case. 
.en: I am the shepherd, princeliness was given to me.

.en: living in the land, 
.en: knowing ‘nig2-du7’ in her city.

.en: You have placed my semen in the inside: you bore me in the cella. 
.en: Gatumdu, your shiny name is sweet. 
.en: I will lay me down here this night, 
.en: you are my big dagger, following my side. 
.en: You are a reed, planted in the big water, 
.en: you have placed life in me. 
.en: You are a broad parasol, under your shade 
.en: let me cool myself there. 
.en: With the index finger? of your right hand, 
.en: ‘stroke’ me with it my lady Gatumdu. 
.en: I will go to the city, may my sign be good. 
.en: To Nina, mountain raising out of the sea, 
.en: may your good Utukku go in front of me, 
.en: may your good Lamma follow me on my path. 
.en: Let me, let me tell it to her. 
.en: Let me, let me tell it to her. 
.en: May she stand by me in this case. 
.en: Let me bring my dream to my mother, 
.en: my dream-interpreter knowing ‘ku3’ by herself, 
.en: Nanše, my divine lady from Siraran, 
.en: may she make its meaning visible for me.” 
.en: His cry was heard. 
.en: His lady, the offering and the prayer, 
.en: Shiny-Gatumdu received from Gudea. 
.en: Did he not place the foot on the barge? 
.en: To her city, Nina, he moored at the port of Nina. 
.en: In the courtyard of the deity of Siraran the governor raised the head to heaven, 
.en: he sacrificed bread, he poured out cold water. 
.en: He went to Nanše, he prayed to her: 
.en: “Nanše, large lady, lady of precious, precious, ‘me’. 
.en: Lady, like Enlil deciding destinies. 
.en: My Nanše, your word is righteous, 
.en: it goes to the top. 
.en: You are the dream interpreter of the gods. 
en: You are the lady of all the lands. Mother, my words, in the day, in the dream. 
en: Inside the dream there was one man, his greatness was like heaven, 
en: his greatness was like the earth. 
en: He, according to his head he was a god, 
en: according to his arm he was the Anzu, 
en: according to his lower body he was the flood. 
en: Lions lay by his right and left. 
en: He spoke to me about the building of his house. 
en: His ‘heart’ I did not understand. 
en: A light went up on the horizon for me. 
en: There was one woman. Who was it, who was it not? 
en: going up to the top she made a haystack on the earth. 
en: She held a stylus of purified silver in the hand. 
en: She had the tablet of the stars on her lap. 
en: She counseled it. 
en: Secondly, it was a hero, 
en: he bent the arm, he held a lapis writing board in the hand, 
en: he drew the plan of the house. 
en: In front of me stood a shiny basket, 
en: a shiny mold was made ready, 
en: the brick of deciding destinies was placed in the mold for me. 
en: In a just poplar standing in front of me, 
en: a ‘tibu’-bird passed the time tweeting. 
en: A donkey stallion, on the right side of my king, scratched the earth for me.” 
en: His mother, Nanše, answered the governor: 
en: “My shepherd, let me, me interpret your dream for you. 
en: The man (who was) great like the heaven, (who was) great like the earth, 
en: (who) according to his head (he was a) god, according to his arm 
en: (he was) the Anzu, according to his lower body the flood, 
en: at (whose) right and left lions were lying, 
en: it is surely my brother Ningirsu. 
en: ‘Build his shrine, the Eninnu!’ He ordered you. 
en: The light that went up for you on the horizon, 
en: it is your god Ningešzida, who like the light went up for you on the horizon. 
en: The virgin, going up to the top, making a haystack on the earth, 
en: holding a stylus of purified silver in her hand, 
en: placing the tablet of the stars on the lap, 
en: counseled it. 
en: That is surely Nisaba, my sister. 
en: (About) the shiny star of the building of the house, 
en: she poured out her voice for you. 
en: The second (one), it was a hero, with bent arm, 
en: holding in the hand a lapis drawing board, 
en: it is Nindubba, placing the house on the plan of the house. 
en: The shiny basket standing in front of you, the prepared shiny mold, 
en: the brick of deciding destinies, placed in the mold, 
en: that is surely the righteous brick of Eninnu. 
en: In the righteous poplar standing in front of you, 
en: a ‘tibu’-bird passed time tweeting, 
en: in order not to let sweet sleep come to your eyes, (so) that the house is build. 
en: A donkey stallion scratching the ground on your kings right side, 
en: that is you, scratching the ground for Eninnu like a ‘choice’ (?) (donkey-)span (?). 
en: Let me give give you instructions, let my instructions be heeded. 
en: (When) you have reached Girsu, the chief house of Lagash: 
en: after you broke the seal of your treasure house, after your brought out wood, 
en: after your have prepared a chariot for your king, 
en: after you harnessed the donkey stallion, 
en: after you decorated this chariot with purified silver and lapis, 
en: (called) ‘quick as light the arrow go out from the quiver’, 
en: after you have cared for ‘Ankara’, the ‘arm of heroism’, 
en: after you have fashioned his beloved emblem, 
en: after you wrote your name on it, 
en: his beloved harp, ‘dragon of the land’, 
en: the famous roaring wood, with which he counsels, 
en: to the hero who loves gifts, 
en: to your king, lord Ningirsu, 
en: after you entered for him into Eninnu, ‘the white Anzu bird’, with it, 
en: he will receive your small word, as if it was a mighty word. 
en: The ‘heart’ of the lord, distant like the heavens, 
en: of Ningirsu, son of Enlil, he will calm for you. 
en: He will reveal the plan of his house to you. 
en: The hero, his ‘me’ are the greatest, 
en: he shall let it grow for you.” 
en: The righteous shepherd Gudea 
en: learnt big, and now he will perform big. 
en: To the word Nanše spoke to him, 
en: he bowed his head. 
en: He broke the seal of his treasure house, 
en: he brought out wood. 
en: Gudea stood by the wood, 
en: he is caring for the wood. 
en: He made the top of the ‘mes’ wood good. 
en: He put the oak wood to the axe. 
en: He made it straight for him, for the lapis chariot. 
en: The donkey stallion, ‘lion called for running’, 
en: he harnesses for it. 
en: He fashioned his beloved emblem for him, 
en: he wrote his name on it. 
en: With his beloved harp, ‘dragon of the land’, 
en: the famous roaring wood, with which he councels, 
en: to the hero loving gifts, 
en: to his king, lord Ningirsu, 
en: in Eninnu, the white Anzu, 
en: he enters. 
en: Joyfully he entered to him in the house. 
en: Didn’t Gudea go out, brilliantly, from the shrine Eninnu? 
en: For the second (time), in(?) the house he passed the days, 
en: he passed the nights. 
en: He flattened the hills, he returned accusations. 
en: He removed the spittle from the dagger. 
en: To Šugalam, the terrible place, the place of rendering justice, 
en: the place of Ningirsu’s looking on all the lands, 
en: the governor, fattened(?) sheep, fat-tail sheep, fattened goats, 
en: un-fertilized sheep, in their hides, he brought in. 
en: Juniper, the pure tree of the mountain he placed on the fire, 
en: cedar incense, the incense of the gods, 
en: its smoke he made. 
en: He rose for his king in public, he prayed to him, 
en: he went to him in ‘ubšu-ukkina’, he greeted him: 
en: “My king, Ningirsu, lord holding back the terrible water, 
en: righteous lord, semen poured out by the ‘great mountain’. 
en: I am the youth not possessing guilt (?). 
en: Ningirsu, I will build your house for you, 
en: (but) my sign is my not. 
en: Hero you poured out the voice to me about the old order, 
en: son of Enlil, lord Ningirsu, 
en: I don’t understand its ‘heart’, 
en: your ‘heart’, surging, like the ocean, 
en: your, receding, like the wave, 
en: your roaring, like cascading water, 
en: like a flood, your crushing of cities, 
en: like the storm, your smashing of rebel lands, 
en: my king, your whirling water which cannot be held back, your ‘heart’. 
en: Hero, your remote, like the heaven, ‘heart’, 
en: son of Enlil, lord Ningirsu, 
en: I, what can I learn from you?” 
en: For the second (time), to the sleeping, to the sleeping, 
en: he stood by his head, he is touching his dagger: 
en: “(That which) you are building for me, (that which) you are building for me, 
en: Governor, the house you are building for me, 
en: Gudea, I will surely give you the sign of the building of my house. 
en: The shiny star of my ‘garza’ I will certainly proclaim for you. 
en: My house, Eninnu, founded by An, 
en: its ‘me’ is bigger than all the other enormous ‘me’ 
en: The king of the house gazes far. 
en: Like the Anzu, its shriek, 
en: makes the heaven tremble. 
en: Its terrible radiance reaches the heaven. 
en: The big fear of my house is spread on all the lands. 
en: At its name all the lands gather at the horizon. 
en: Magan (and) Meluhha will descend from their land. 
en: I Ningirsu, holding back the terrible water,

en: Statue, to my master 
en: do say thus: 
en: When the Eninnu, 
en: his beloved temple, 
en: I built for him, 
en: I had debts remitted and I washed all hands. 
en: For seven days no barley was ground. 
en: The slave woman was made equal with her mistress, 
en: and by the slave 
en: his master stood side by side. 
en: In my city the sexually impure with respect to him (Ningirsu) 
en: I made to go out to sleep at the edge of it. 
en: Evil to its house 
en: I made go back. 
en: To the laws 
en: of Nanše 
en: and Ningirsu 
en: I attended. 
en: An orphan I did not let be put under the control of a rich person. 
en: and a widow I did not let be put under the control of a powerful person. 
en: For an estate not having a son, 
en: a daughter of it its heir 
en: I made become. 
en: The stone statue 
en: he made receptive to messages. 
en: This statue 
en: is neither of silver, nor is it of lapis lazuli. 
en: It is neither of copper nor of tin, 
en: nor is it of bronze. 
en: No one must put it to any other use, 
en: and so it is (made only of) diorite. 
en: Let it stand at the place of libations. 
en: By an act of force 
en: let no one destroy it. 
en: O statue, before you 
en: is (standing a statue) of Ningirsu! 
en: The statue 
en: of Gudea, 
en: the ruler 
en: of Lagash, 
en: the man by whom the Eninnu 
en: of Ningirsu 
en: was built-
en: any person who from the Eninnu 
en: shall remove it, 
en: or its inscription 
en: shall erase from it, 
en: or any person who shall destroy it; 
en: at the beginning of a good year, 
en: a (future) person whom, as did my god, 
en: his (own) god 
en: Ningirsu, 
en: my master, 
en: has called to from among all the people, 
en: who (then) my judgments 
en: shall overturn, 
en: my gifts 
en: would revoke, 
en: and from my collected songs 
en: having displaced my name 
en: shall set his own name on them; 
en: who in the courtyard of Ningirsu my master 
en: shall abandon its established shrines, 
en: without having kept before his eyes 
en: that since days of old, 
en: since the seed (first) emerged, 
en: when a ruler 
en: of Lagash, 
en: the Eninnu 
en: for Ningirsu 
en: my master 
en: had built-
en: being a person who had made a fitting thing come forth resplendently-
en: his words 
en: no one shall ever alter, 
en: nor ever overturn his judgments. 
en: Therefore regarding Gudea, 
en: the ruler 
en: of Lagash, 
en: anyone who shall alter his word, 
en: or shall overturn his judgments, 
en: may An, 
en: Enlil, 
en: Ninhursaga, 
en: Enki, he of the righteous utterance, 
en: Suen, whose name no one can explain, 
en: Ningirsu, 
en: the king of weaponry,

en: Ninmar, 
en: the eldest daughter of Nanše, 
en: Dumuzi'abzu, 
en: the mistress of Kinunir, 
en: and my (personal) god Ningešzida, 
en: may they all change his fate. 
en: Like an ox 
en: may he be slaughtered in his noonday (prime). 
en: Like an aurochs 
en: may he be seized by his fierce horns. 
en: May his throne which people had set up for him 
en: be made to sit out in the dust. 
en: If 
en: to erasing this inscription 
en: he should set his mind, 
en: let his own name in the house of his god 
en: from the tablets be removed. 
en: May his own god 
en: not look upon the settled(?) people. 
en: May he hold back the rain in the sky 
en: and hold back the waters upon the earth. 
en: May years of dearth stretch out for him, 
en: and may there be famine during his reign. 
en: That person, 
en: like a man who does evil to a righteous person, 
en: may that one’s end produce a shutting(?) in heaven, 
en: and may it not be released. 
en: Of the most forceful of all the gods, 
en: of lord Ningirsu, 
en: may his greatness 
en: be known by the nation.

r.en: from Kish to Gilgamesh in Uruk came. 
r.en: Gilgamesh before the elders of his city, 
r.en: presented the issue, carefully choosing his words: 
r.en: There are wells to be finished, wells of the Land yet to be finished; 
r.en: there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished, 
r.en: there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed. 
r.en: To the house of Kish We should not submit! Should we not smite it with weapons? 
r.en: In the convened assembly, the elders of his city 
.en: answer Gilgamesh: 
.en: “There are indeed wells to be finished, wells of the Land yet to be finished; 
.en: there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished, 
.en: there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed. 
.en: So we should submit to the house of Kish. We should not smite it with weapons! 
.en: Gilgamesh, the lord of Kulaba, 
.en: in Inanna placing his trust 
.en: the advice of the elders of his city did not take seriously. 
.en: a second time Gilgamesh before the able-bodied men of his city 
.en: presented the issue, carefully choosing his words: 
.en: “There are wells to be finished, wells of the Land yet to be finished; 
.en: there are shallow wells of the Land yet to be finished, 
.en: there are wells to deepen and hoisting gear to be completed. 
.en: Never before have you submitted to the house of Kish. Should you not smite it with weapons? 
.en: In the convened assembly, the able-bodied men of his city answer Gilgamesh: 
.en: “Standing on duty and sitting in attendance, 
.en: the son of the king escorting, 
.en: the reins of the donkey always grasping, 
.en: who has the breath?,” as the saying goes. 
.en: To the house of Kish you all should not submit! With weapons should we not smite it?” 
.en: “The structure of Uruk, the handiwork of the gods, 
.en: and of Eanna, the house from heaven lowered down, 
.en: the great gods created. 
.en: The great wall, the wall which An founded, 
.en: the majestic residence which An established, 
.en: you watch over. You are its king and warrior, 
.en: an exuberant person, a prince by An beloved. 
.en: When Aga comes, what terror he will experience! 
.en: That army is small, at the rear scattered. 
.en: Its men will be incapable of confronting us.” 
.en: Then Gilgamesh, the lord of Kulaba, 
.en: at the advice of the able-bodied men of his city rejoiced and his spirit brightened. 
.en: His servant Enkidu he addressed: 
.en: “On this account let the weaponry and arms of battle be made ready. 
.en: Let the battle mace to your side return. 
.en: A great terror and radiance may they create. 
.en: When he comes, my great fearsomeness will overwhelm him. 
.en: His reasoning will become confused, his judgment disarrayed.” 
.en: Not 5 days, not 10 days had passed 
.en: when Aga, the son of Enmebaragesi, to Uruk with his men laid siege . 
.en: Uruk’s reasoning became confused. 
.en: Gilgamesh, the lord of Kulaba, 
.en: to its warriors speaks: 
.en: “My warriors shall have the choice. 
.en: Let someone with courage rise up, “I shall go against Aga” 
.en: Birḫurtura, his royal guard, 
.en: in admiration to his king says: 
.en: I shall go against Aga. 
.en: so that his reasoning will become confused, his judgment disarrayed.” 
.en: Birḫurtura through the city gate went out. 
.en: As soon as Birḫurtura went out through the city gate, 
.en: at the gate of the city gate they captured him, 
.en: Birḫurtura’s entire length beating. 
.en: Into the presence of Aga he came 
.en: speaking to Aga. 
.en: His words were not done, a “mirror-holder” of Uruk, on the wall climbing up, 
.en: out over the wall leaned. 
.en: Aga trained his eyes, 
.en: to Birḫurtura speaking: 
.en: “Slave, is that man your king?” 
.en: “That man is not my king! 
.en: Were that man my king, 
.en: were that his angry brow, 
.en: were those his bison eyes, 
.en: were that his lapis lazuli beard, 
.en: were those his elegant fingers, 
.en: would he not cast down multitudes? Would he not raise up multitudes? 
.en: Would multitudes not be smeared with dust? 
.en: Would not all the nations be overwhelmed? 
.en: Would not the (canal-)mouths of the land be filled with silt? 
.en: Would not the horns of the barges be broken? 
.en: Would he not take captive Aga, the king of Kish, in the midst of his army?” 
.en: Hitting him, striking him, 
.en: Birḫurtura’s entire length they were beating. 
.en: After the “mirror-holder” of Uruk, Gilgamesh climbs up on the wall. 
.en: the young and old of Kulaba his radiance overwhelms. 
.en: The able-bodied men of Uruk with battle maces he armed, 
.en: on the causeway at the door of the city gate stationed. 
.en: Enkidu through the city gate alone went out. 
.en: Gilgamesh out over the wall leaned. 
.en: Looking up, Aga opened his eyes: 
.en: “Slave, is that man your king?” 
.en: “That man is indeed my king.” 
.en: It was just as he had said: 
.en: Multitudes fell, multitudes rose up, 
.en: multitudes with dust were smeared, 
.en: all the nations were overwhelmed, 
.en: the (canal-)mouths of the land with silt were filled, 
.en: the horns of the barges were broken, 
.en: Aga, the king of Kish, in the midst of his army he took captive 
en: Gilgamesh, the lord of Kulaba, 
en: to Aga speaks: 
en: “Aga my foreman, Aga my lieutenant, 
en: Aga my commander of the troops! 
en: Aga gave me breath, Aga gave me life: 
en: Aga a fugitive into his embrace took, 
en: Aga the fleeing bird with grain provided.” 
en: “Uruk, the handiwork of the gods, 
en: the great wall, the wall which An founded, 
en: the majestic residence which An established, 
en: you watch over. You are its king and warrior, 
en: an exuberant person, a prince beloved of An.” 
en: “Before Utu, your former kindness is hereby repaid to you.” 
en: Aga to Kish he set free. 
en: As to Gilgamesh, lord of Kulaba, 
en: your praise is sweet.

r.en: with wickedness filled,

.en: took away from him,
.en: who from one with a child his child
.en: took away from him,
.en: who wickedness and violence
.en: produced within the country—
.en: Enlil, the king of all the lands,
.en: to obliterate its name,
.en: Utuḫegal,
.en: the mighty man,
.en: the king of Uruk,
.en: the king of the four world quarters,
.en: the king whose utterances cannot be countermanded,
.en: Enlil, the king of all the lands,
.en: issued to him a command about this.
.en: To Inanna his lady
.en: he went
.en: and prayed to her, (saying)
.en: “My lady, lioness of battle,
.en: who the foreign lands batters,
.en: Enlil, the kingship of Sumer
.en: to return to its own control
.en: he commanded me.
.en: May you be my ally.”
.en: An army of many foreigners
.en: bore down upon the land everywhere.
.en: Tirigan,
.en: the king of Gutium,
.en: opened its (canal?) mouths,
.en: but no one came out against him.
.en: Both banks of the Tigris
.en: he had seized.
.en: To the south, in Sumer,
.en: the cultivated land he tied up,
.en: to the north, the roads he tied up.
.en: On the highways of the country
.en: he made tall grasses grow.
.en: But the king to whom Enlil
.en: had given power,
.en: whom Inanna by (her own) heart had chosen,
.en: Utuḫegal, the mighty man,
.en: from Uruk went out against him.
.en: In the temple of Iškur
.en: he made an offering.
.en: To the citizens of his city
.en: he was calling out, (saying)
.en: “Gutium
.en: Enlil has given to me.
.en: My mistress Inanna
.en: is my ally.
.en: Dumuzi-Ama’ušumgalana
.en: has declared ‛It is something that concerns me,’
.en: and Gilgameš,
.en: the son of Ninsun,
.en: as bailiff he has given to me.”
.en: The citizens of Uruk
.en: and the citizens of Kullab
.en: he caused to rejoice at this.
.en: His city, as one man,
.en: followed after him.
.en: The military contingents and scouts
.en: he put in good order.
.en: After having departed from the temple of Iškur,
.en: on the 4th day in Nagsu on the Enurigal canal
.en: he made an offering.
.en: On the 5th day at Bara-Ilitappe
.en: he made an offering.
.en: Ur-Ninazu
.en: and Nabi-Enlil,
.en: generals of Tirigan
.en: who to Sumer as envoys
.en: had been sent,
.en: he captured and put fetters on their hands.
.en: Having departed from Bara-Ilitappe,
.en: on the 6th day at Karkar
.en: he made an offering.
.en: He went in to Iškur
.en: and prayed to him.
.en: “O Iškur, Enlil has given me the weapons,
.en: may you be my ally.”
.en: In the middle of that night he arose,
.en: and north of Adab,
.en: when Utu had risen,
.en: he went
.en: and prayed to him, (saying)
.en: “O Utu, Gutium
.en: Enlil has given to me,
.en: may you be my ally.”
.en: At that place, (just) beyond Gutium,
.en: he laid a trap(?) for him,
.en: and the troops he drove to him.
en: Utuḫegal, the mighty man,
en: defeated
en: their generals. Whereupon, Tirigan,
en: king of Gutium,
en: fled all alone from there.
en: The place where to save his life
en: he had fled,
en: in Dabrum, they (at first) were good to him.
en: (But) the people of Dabrum,
en: Utuḫegal,
en: because, he a king to whom Enlil had given power
en: he was, they had realized,
en: Tirigan
en: they did not let go.
en: By the envoys of Utuḫegal
en: Tirigan
en: and his wife and children
en: in Dabrum were captured.
en: They placed fetters on his hands
en: and put a cloth (blindfold) over his eyes.
en: Utuḫegal before Utu
en: made him lie at his (Utu’s) feet,
en: and on his neck he set his foot.
en: Gutium, the fanged snake of the mountain ranges,
en: he made drink from the cracks in the earth.
en: he made an offering.
en: The tow-boats he dispatched from its borders,
en: and the kingship of Sumer to its control he returned.

r.en: Enlil, whose kingship
r.en: of all the gods

en: knows how to put in place,
en: may you both be his shining light.
en: (Zababa and Ištar) the most majestic of the gods,
en: at the words that their father Enlil

en: their hearts rejoiced full of delight.
en: To Samsu-iluna,
en: the mighty king, the shepherd and hero,
en: their accomplishment,
en: their countenances of life
en: they lifted shiningly towards him,
en: and joyfully they conversed with him.

en: Enlil

en: To act with well-being as (your) guardian genies

en: The city Kiš, our [awe-inpiring] cult site,

en: Samsu-iluna,
en: Iluni, the king of Ešnunna,

en: With his neck held in a neck-stock
en: he brought him in,
en: and his life he slew with a knife.
en: All of Sumer and Akkad
en: he caused to be of one mind.
en: The four world quarters
en: under his command he caused to dwell.
en: At that time, Samsu-iluna, the mighty man,
en: through the strength of his army,
en: rebuilt the the city Kiš.
en: He dug its canal,
en: and with much earth its foundation
r.en: Samsu-iluna,

r.en: of one mind,
r.en: the king who, at the order
r.en: of An and Enlil,
r.en: all those who hated him
.en: a smashing
.en: delivered,
.en: the shepherd for whom Inanna
.en: her favorable omen
.en: and assistance
.en: performed,
.en: the man who of those who turned away from him in their ...
.en: bound their hands,
.en: one who evil-doers
.en: made disappear from the country,
.en: who a shining light among the numerous people
.en: made come forth,
.en: foremost heir
.en: of Hammurapi
.en: the ruler who broadened the country,

.en: which had acted hostile to him
.en: did strike with pickaxes,
.en: and who his victories
.en: did so achieve
.en: and his force of arms
.en: did make brilliantly apparent -
.en: When two months had passed,
.en: the people of the land of Idamaraz
.en: which he had treated as booty,
.en: and the troops of Ešnunna
.en: as many as he had taken as captives,
.en: having set them free
.en: and a life-giving hand
.en: having put out to them,
.en: the various fortresses of the country
.en: of Warum
.en: which he had destroyed
.en: having rebuilt,
.en: and their scattered people
.en: having gathered up again
.en: and returned to their places,
.en: then Samsu-iluna, the mighty man,
.en: that the people who on the banks of the Durul
.en: and the Țaban rivers
.en: were dwelling
.en: could live in peaceful residences,
.en: that they may have no persons terrifying them,
.en: and that the mighty force

.en: within two months time
.en: on the bank of the Durul canal

.en: heaped up its earth there,
.en: formed the bricks for it,

.en: for the hero, youthful Utu,

.en: regarding Sippar and the Ebabbar temple
.en: had been decreed
.en: happily
.en: was set in place for him.

.en: I raised up like a great mountain.
.en: I renovated the Ebabbar,
.en: their exalted high terrace of the ziggurrat
.en: I raised up its top like the sky,
.en: and Utu, Iškur

.en: amidst very happy rejoicing

r.en: O Enlil with exalted utterances, your judgments being high and wide,

.en: opening wide his knees on the highway, striding towards battle and combat,

.en: he set it up and colored it brilliantly. 
.en: The great prince of the whole heaven, the lord whose utterance cannot be altered, 
.en: his shining brow and raised righteous eyes 
.en: may he let be upon him, directed towards the faithful shepherd whom he has engendered. 
.en: But a king who orders a wicked thing,

.en: How did you set your heart on the road whose traveller never returns?” 
.en: Holy Inanna answers him: 
.en: “Because lord Gud-gal-ana, 
.en: the husband of my elder sister holy Ereškigal, has died; 
.en: in order to have his funeral rites observed, 
.en: she offers generous libations at his wake; that is the reason.” 
.en: Neti, the chief doorman of the underworld, 
.en: answers holy Inanna: 
.en: “Stay here, Inanna. I will speak to my mistress. 
.en: I will speak to my mistress Ereškigal and tell her what you have said.” 
.en: Neti, the chief doorman of the underworld, 
.en: to his mistress Ereškigal 
.en: entered the house and said: 
.en: “My mistress, there is a lone girl outside. 
.en: It is Inanna, your sister, and she has arrived at the palace Ganzer. 
.en: She pushed aggressively on the door of the underworld. 
en: She shouted aggressively at the gate of the underworld. 
en: She has abandoned Eanna and has descended to the underworld. 
en: “She has taken the 7 divine powers. 
en: She has collected the divine powers and grasped them in her hand. 
en: She has come on her way with all the good divine powers. 
en: She has put a turban, headgear for the open country, on her head. 
en: She has taken a wig for her forehead. 
en: She has hung small lapis-lazuli beads around her neck. 
en: “She has placed twin egg-shaped beads on her breast. 
en: She has covered her body with the pala dress of ladyship. 
en: She has placed mascara “Let a man come” on her eyes. 
en: She has pulled the pectoral “Come, man, come” over her breast. 
en: She has placed a golden ring on her hand. 
en: She is holding the lapis-lazuli ‘reed-1-ninda’ measuring rod and measuring line in her hand.” 
en: When she heard this, Ereškigal slapped the side of her thigh. 
en: She bit her lip and took the words to heart. 
en: She says to Neti, her chief doorman: 
en: “Come Neti, my chief doorman of the underworld, 
en: don’t neglect the instructions I will give you. 
en: Let the seven gates of the underworld be bolted. 
en: Then let each door of the palace Ganzer be opened separately. 
en: As for her, after she has entered, 
en: and crouched down and had her clothes removed, they will be carried away.” 
en: Neti, the chief doorman of the underworld, 
en: paid attention to the instructions of his mistress. 
en: He bolted the 7 gates of the underworld. 
en: Then he opened each of the doors of the palace Ganzer separately. 
en: He says to holy Inanna: 
en: “Come on, Inanna, and enter.” 
en: And when Inanna entered, 
en: the turban, headgear for the open country, was removed from her head. 
en: “What is this?” 
en: “Be satisfied, Inanna, a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled. 
en: Inanna, you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld.” 
en: When she entered the 2nd gate, 
en: the small lapis-lazuli beads were removed from her neck. 
en: “What is this?” 
en: “Be satisfied, Inanna, a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled. 
en: Inanna, you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld.” 
en: When she entered the 3rd gate, 
en: the twin egg-shaped beads were removed from her breast. 
en: “What is this?” 
en: “Be satisfied, Inanna, a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled. 
en: Inanna, you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld.” 
en: When she entered the 4th gate, 
en: the pectoral “Come, man, come” was removed from her breast. 
en: “What is this?” 
en: “Be satisfied, Inanna, a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled. 
en: Inanna, you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld.” 
en: When she entered the 5th gate, 
en: the golden ring was removed from her hand. 
en: “What is this?” 
en: “Be satisfied, Inanna, a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled. 
en: Inanna, you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld.” 
en: When she entered the 6th gate, 
en: the lapis-lazuli measuring rod and measuring line were removed from her hand. 
en: “What is this?” 
en: “Be satisfied, Inanna, a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled. 
en: Inanna, you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld.” 
en: When she entered the 7th gate, 
en: the pala dress, the garment of ladyship, was removed from her body. 
en: “What is this?” 
en: “Be satisfied, Inanna, a divine power of the underworld has been fulfilled. 
en: Inanna, you must not open your mouth against the rites of the underworld.” 
en: After she had crouched down and had her clothes removed, they were carried away. 
en: Then she made her sister Ereškigal rise from her throne, 
en: and instead she sat on her throne. 
en: The Anuna, the seven judges, rendered their decision against her. 
en: They looked at her—it was the look of death! 
en: They spoke to her—it was the speech of anger! 
en: They shouted at her—it was the shout of heavy guilt! 
en: The afflicted woman was turned into a corpse! 
en: And the corpse was hung on a hook. 
en: After 3 days and 3 nights had passed, 
en: her minister Ninšubur 
en: carried out the instructions of her mistress. 
en: She made a lament for her in her ruined (houses). 
en: She beat the drum for her in the sanctuaries. 
en: She made the rounds of the houses of the gods for her. 
en: She lacerated her eyes for her, she lacerated her nose. 
en: In private she lacerated her buttocks for her. 
en: Like a pauper, she clothed herself in a single garment, 
en: and all alone she set her foot in the E-kur, the house of Enlil. 
en: When she had entered the E-kur, the house of Enlil, 
en: she laments before Enlil: 
en: “Father Enlil, don’t let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld. 
en: Don’t let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld. 
en: Don’t let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the mason’s stone. 
en: Don’t let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenter’s wood. 
en: Don’t let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld.” 
en: In his rage father Enlil answers Ninšubur: 
en: “My daughter craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well. 
en: Inanna craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well. 
en: The divine powers of the underworld are divine powers which should not be craved, for whoever gets them must remain in the underworld. 
en: Who, having got to that place, could then expect to come up again?” 
en: Thus father Enlil did not help in this matter, so she went to Ur. 
en: In the E-mud-kura at Ur, 
en: when she had entered the E-kišnugal, the house of Nanna, 
en: she laments before Nanna: 
en: “Father Nanna, don’t let your daughter be killed in the underworld. 
en: Don’t let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld. 
en: Don’t let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the mason’s stone. 
en: Don’t let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenter’s wood. 
en: Don’t let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld.” 
en: In his rage father Nanna answers Ninšubur: 
en: “My daughter craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well. 
en: Inanna craved the great heaven and she craved the great below as well. 
en: The divine powers of the underworld are divine powers which should not be craved, for whoever gets them must remain in the underworld. 
en: Who, having got to that place, could then expect to come up again?” 
en: Thus father Nanna did not help her in this matter, so she went to Eridu. 
en: In Eridu, when she had entered the house of Enki, 
en: xshe laments before Enki:xx 
en: “Father Enki, don’t let anyone kill your daughter in the underworld. 
en: Don’t let your precious metal be alloyed there with the dirt of the underworld. 
en: Don’t let your precious lapis lazuli be split there with the mason’s stone. 
en: Don’t let your boxwood be chopped up there with the carpenter’s wood. 
en: Don’t let young lady Inanna be killed in the underworld.” 
en: Father Enki answered Ninšubur: 
en: “What has my daughter done? She has me worried. 
en: What has Inanna done? She has me worried. 
en: What has the mistress of all the lands done? She has me worried. 
en: What has the hierodule of An done? She has me worried.” 
en: He removed some dirt from the tip of his fingernail and created the kur-gar. 
en: He removed some dirt from the tip of his 2nd fingernail and created the gala-tur. 
en: To the kur-gar he gave the life-giving plant. 
en: To the gala-tura he gave the life-giving water. 
en: Then father Enki speaks out to the gala-tura and the kur-gar: 
en: Go and direct your steps to the underworld. 
en: Flit past the door like flies. 
en: Slip through the door pivots like phantoms. 
en: The birth-mother, on account of her children, 
en: Ereškigal, is lying there. 
en: Her holy shoulders are not covered by a linen cloth. 
en: Her breasts are not full like a cagan vessel. 
en: Her nails are like a pickaxe (?) upon her. 
en: The hair on her head is bunched up as if it were leeks. 
en: “When she says “Oh my heart,” 
en: you are to say “You are troubled, our mistress, oh your heart.” 
en: When she says “Oh my liver,” 
en: you are to say “You are troubled, our mistress, oh your liver.” 
en: (She will then ask:) “Who are you? 
en: Speaking to you from my heart to your heart, from my liver to your liver— 
en: if you are gods, let me talk with you; 
en: if you are mortals, may a destiny be decreed for you.” 
en: Make her swear this by heaven and earth. 
en: Go on out, 
en: They will offer you a riverful of water—don’t accept it. 
en: They will offer you a field with its grain—don’t accept it. 
en: But say to her: “Give us the corpse hanging on the hook.” 
en: (She will answer:) “That is the corpse of your queen.” 
en: Say to her: “Whether it is that of our king, whether it is that of our queen, give it to us.” 
en: She will give you the corpse hanging on the hook. 
en: 1 of you sprinkle on it the life-giving plant and 1 the life-giving water. 
en: Thus let Inanna rise up.” 
en: The gala-tura and the kur-gar paid attention to the instructions of Enki. 
en: They flitted through the door like flies. 
en: They slipped through the door pivots like phantoms. 
en: The birth-mother, because of her children, 
en: Ereškigal, was lying there. 
en: Her holy shoulders were not covered by a linen cloth. 
en: Her breasts were not full like a cagan vessel. 
en: Her nails were like a pickaxe (?) upon her. 
en: The hair on her head was bunched up as if it were leeks. 
en: When she said “Oh my heart,” 
en: they said to her “You are troubled, our mistress, oh your heart.” 
en: When she said “Oh my liver,” 
en: they said to her “You are troubled, our mistress, oh your liver.” 
en: (Then she asked:) “Who are you? 
en: I tell you from my heart to your heart, from my liver to your liver— 
en: if you are gods, I will talk with you; 
en: if you are mortals, may a destiny be decreed for you.” 
en: They made her swear this by heaven and earth. 
en: they went on out, 
en: they were offered a river with its water—they did not accept it. 
en: They were offered a field with its grain—they did not accept it. 
en: They said to her: “Give us the corpse hanging on the hook.” 
en: Holy Ereškigal answers the gala-tura and the kur-gar: 
en: “The corpse is that of your queen.” 
en: They said to her: “Whether it is that of our king or that of our queen, give it to us.” 
en: They were given the corpse hanging on the hook. 
en: 1 of them sprinkled on it the life-giving plant and 1 the life-giving water. 
en: And thus Inanna rose up. 
en: Ereškigal says to the gala-tura and the kur-gar: 
en: “Bring your queen ..., your ... has been seized.” 
en: Inanna, because of Enki’s instructions, was about to ascend from the underworld. 
en: But as Inanna was about to ascend from the underworld, 
en: the Anuna seized her: 
en: “Who has ever ascended from the underworld, has ascended unscathed from the underworld? 
en: If Inanna is to ascend from the underworld, 
en: let her provide a substitute for herself.” 
en: So when Inanna left the underworld, 
en: the one in front of her, though not a minister, held a sceptre in his hand; 
en: the one behind her, though not an escort, carried a mace at his hip, 
en: while the small demons, like a reed enclosure, 
en: and the big demons, like the reeds of a fence, restrained her on all sides. 
en: Those who accompanied her, 
en: those who accompanied Inanna, 
en: know no food, know no drink, 
en: eat no flour offering 
en: and drink no libation. 
en: They accept no pleasant gifts. 
en: They take away the child hanging on a wet-nurse’s breasts. 
en: They crush no bitter garlic. 
en: They eat no fish, they eat no leeks. 
en: They, it was, who accompanied Inanna. 
en: After Inanna had ascended from the underworld, 
en: Ninšubur threw herself at her feet at the door of the Ganzer. 
en: She had sat in the dust and clothed herself in a filthy garment. 
en: The demons said to holy Inanna: 
en: “Inanna, proceed to your city, we will take her back.” 
en: Holy Inanna answers the demons: 
en: “This is my minister of fair words, 
en: my escort of trustworthy words. 
en: She did not forget my instructions. 
en: She did not neglect the orders I gave her. 
en: She made a lament for me on the ruin mounds. 
en: She beat the drum for me in the sanctuaries. 
en: She made the rounds of the gods’ houses for me. 
en: She lacerated her eyes for me, lacerated her nose for me. 
en: In private, she lacerated her buttocks for me. 
en: Like a pauper, she clothed herself in a single garment. 
en: “To the house of Enlil, 
en: and to Ur, to the house of Nanna, 
en: and to Eridu, to the house of Enki, 
en: all alone she directed her steps. 
en: She brought me back to life. 
en: How could I turn her over to you? 
en: Let us go on. Let us go on to the Šegkuršaga in Umma.” 
en: At the Šegkuršaga in Umma, 
en: Šara, in his own city, threw himself at her feet. 
en: He had sat in the dust and dressed himself in a filthy garment. 
en: The demons say to holy Inanna: 
en: “Inanna, proceed to your city, we will take him back.” 
en: Holy Inanna answered the demons: 
en: “Šara is my singer, 
en: my manicurist and my hairdresser. 
en: How could I turn him over to you? 
en: Let us go on. Let us go on to the E-muškalama in Bad-tibira.” 
en: At the E-muškalama in Bad-tibira, 
en: Lulal, in his own city, threw himself at her feet. 
en: He had sat in the dust and clothed himself in a filthy garment. 
en: The demons said to holy Inanna: 
en: “Inanna, proceed to your city, we will take him back.” 
en: Holy Inanna answers the demons: 
en: “Outstanding Lulal follows me at my right and my left. 
en: How could I turn him over to you? 
en: Let us go on. Let us go on to the great apple tree in the plain of Kulaba.” 
en: They followed her to the great apple tree in the plain of Kulaba. 
en: There was Dumuzi clothed in a magnificent garment and seated magnificently on a throne. 
en: The demons seized him there by his thighs. 
en: The 7 of them poured the milk from his churns. 
en: The seven of them shook their heads like ... 
en: They would not let the shepherd play the pipe and flute before her (?). 
en: She looked at him, it was the look of death. 
en: She spoke to him (?), it was the speech of anger. 
en: She shouted at him (?), it was the shout of heavy guilt: 
en: “How much longer? Take him away.” 
en: Holy Inanna gave Dumuzi the shepherd into their hands. 
en: Those who had accompanied her, 
en: who had come for Dumuzi, 
en: know no food, know no drink, 
en: eat no flour offering, 
en: drink no libation. 
en: They never enjoy the pleasures of the marital embrace, 
en: never have any sweet children to kiss. 
en: They snatch the son from a man’s knee. 
en: They make the bride leave the house of her father-in-law. 
en: Dumuzi let out a wail and turned very pale. 
en: The lad raised his hands to heaven, to Utu: 
en: “Utu, you are my brother-in-law. 
en: I am your relation by marriage. I brought butter oil to your mother’s house 
en: I brought cheese to Ningal’s house. 
en: Turn my hands into snake’s hands 
en: and turn my feet into snake’s feet, 
en: so I can escape my demons, let them not keep hold of me.” 
en: Utu accepted his tears. 
en: Utu turned Dumuzi’s hands into snake’s hands. 
en: He turned his feet into snake’s feet. 
en: Dumuzi escaped his demons. 
en: having seized ..., 
en: Holy Inanna ... her heart. 
en: Holy Inanna ... her heart. 
en: Holy Inanna ... her heart. 
en: Holy Inanna wept bitterly for her husband. 
en: Holy Inanna ... Dumuzi ... her heart ... 
en: ... her husband ... by force ... 
en: ... like ... 
en: ... like ... 
en: She tore at her hair like esparto grass, she ripped it out like esparto grass. 
en: “You wives who lie in your men’s embrace, where is my precious husband? 
en: You children who lie in your men’s embrace, where is my precious child? 
en: Where is my man? Where ...? 
en: Where is my man? Where ...?” 
en: A fly speaks to holy Inanna: 
en: “If I show you where your man is, what will be my reward?” 
en: Holy Inanna answers the fly: 
en: “If you show me where my man is, I will give you this gift: 
en: I will cover ... .” 
en: The fly helped (?) holy Inanna. 
en: The young lady Inanna decreed the destiny of the fly: 
en: “In the beer-house and the tavern (?), may there ... for you. 
en: You will live (?) like the sons of the wise.” 
en: Now Inanna decreed this fate and thus it came to be. 
en: ... was weeping. 
en: She came up to the sister (?) and ... by the hand: 
en: “Now, alas, my ... 
en: You for half the year and your sister for half the year: 
en: when you are demanded, on that day you will stay, 
en: when your sister is demanded, on that day you will be released.” 
en: Thus holy Inanna gave Dumuzi as a substitute ... 
en: Holy Ereškigal: 
en: sweet is your praise.

en: of Amar-Suena 
.en: until King Ibbi-Suen 
.en: chose En-am-gal-ana by extispicy as the high priest of inanna of Uruk, 
.en: Ninlil came regularly to the Tummal. 
.en: Written according to the words of Lu-inanna the chief leatherworker of Enlil. 
.en: Išbi-Erra, who looks after the E-kur, 
.en: built the storehouse of Enlil. 
r.en: To ...... the sanctuary like a cargo ship;
r.en: to ...... its great furnaces;
r.en: to see that its canals ...... waters of joy for eternity,
r.en: to see that the hoes till the arable tracts and that ...... the fields;
r.en: to turn the house of Kiš, which was like a haunted town, into a living settlement again,
r.en: its king, shepherd Ur-Zababa,
r.en: rose like Utu over the house of Kiš.
r.en: However, to alter his term of reigning and to remove the prosperity of the palace
r.en: An and Enlil authoritatively (?) decided (?) by their holy command.
.en: Then Sargon - his city was the city of ......,
.en: his father was La’ibum, his mother ......
.en: Sargon ...... with happy heart.
.en: Since he was born ...
r.en: One day, after the evening had arrived,
r.en: and Sargon had brought the regular deliveries to the palace,
r.en: He Ur-Zababa was sleeping (and dreaming) in the holy bed-chamber, his holy residence.
r.en: He realised what the dream was about, but did not put into words, did not discuss it with anyone.
r.en: After Sargon had received the regular deliveries for the palace,
r.en: Ur-Zababa appointed him cupbearer, putting him in charge of the drinks cupboard.
r.en: Holy inanna did not cease to stand by him.
r.en: After five or 10 days had passed,
r.en: King Ur-Zababa ...... and became frightened in his residence.
.en: Like a lion he urinated, sprinkling his legs, and the urine contained blood and pus.
.en: He was troubled, he was disturbed like a fish living in brackish water.
.en: It was then that the cupbearer of Ezina's wine-house,
.en: Sargon, lay down not to sleep, but lay down to dream.
.en: In the dream, holy inanna drowned Ur-Zababa in a river of blood.
.en: The sleeping Sargon groaned and gnawed the ground.
.en: When King Ur-Zababa heard about this groaning,
.en: he was brought into the king's holy presence,
.en: Sargon was brought into the presence of Ur-Zababa (who said:)
.en: "Cupbearer, was a dream revealed to you in the night?"
.en: Sargon answered his king:
.en: My king, this is my dream, which I will tell you about:
.en: There was a young woman who was as high as the heavens and as broad as the earth.
.en: She was firmly set as the base of a wall.
.en: For me, she drowned you in a great river, a river of blood."
.en: Ur-Zababa chewed his lips, he became seriously afraid.
.en: He spoke to ......, his chancellor:
.en: "My royal sister, holy inanna,
.en: is going to change (?) my finger into a ...... of blood;
.en: she will drown Sargon, the cupbearer, in the great river.
.en: Beliš-tikal, chief smith, man of my choosing, who can write tablets,
.en: I will give you orders, let my orders be carried out!
.en: Let my advice be followed!
.en: Now then, when the cupbearer has delivered my bronze hand-mirror (?) to you
.en: in the E-sikil, the fated house, throw them (the mirror and Sargon) into the mould like statues."
.en: Beliš-tikal heeded his king's words
.en: and prepared the moulds in the E-sikil, the fated house.
.en: The king spoke to Sargon:
.en: "Go and deliver my bronze hand-mirror (?) to the chief smith!"
en: Sargon left the palace of Ur-Zababa.
.en: Holy inanna, however, did not cease to stand at his right hand side,
.en: and before he had come within five or 10 ninda of the E-sikil, the fated house,
.en: holy inanna turned around toward him and blocked his way, (saying:)
.en: "The E-sikil is a holy house! No one polluted with blood should enter it!"
.en: Thus he met the chief smith of the king only at the gate of the fated house.
.en: After he delivered the king's bronze hand-mirror (?) to the chief smith,
.en: Beliš-tikal, the chief smith, ...... and threw it into the mould like statues.
.en: After five or 10 days had passed, Sargon
.en: came into the presence of Ur-Zababa, his king;
.en: he came into the palace, firmly founded like a great mountain.
.en: King Ur-Zababa ...... and became frightened in his residence.
.en: He realised what was it about, but did not put into words, did not discuss it with anyone.
.en: Ur-Zababa became frightened in the bed-chamber, his holy residence.
.en: He realised what was it about, but did not put into words, did not discuss it with anyone.
.en: In those days, although writing words on tablets existed, putting tablets into envelopes did not yet exist.
.en: King Ur-Zababa despatched Sargon, the creature of the gods,
.en: with a message written on clay, which was about murdering Sargon
.en: to Lugal-zage-si in Uruk.
r.en: With the wife of Lugal-zage-si ...
r.en: She gave(?) her feminity as a shelter ...
r.en: Lugal-zage-si did not ... the envoy.
r.en: "Come! He directed his steps to brick-built E-ana!"
r.en: Lugal-zage-si did not grasp it, he did not talk to the envoy.
r.en: But as soon as he did talk to the envoy ...
r.en: "Alas!" and sat in the dust.
r.en: Lugal-zage-si replied to the envoy:
r.en: "Envoy, Sargon does not yield."
.en: After he has submitted,Sargon ... Lugal-zage-si ...
.en: Sargon ... Lugal-zage-si ...
.en: Why .... Sargon ....?
r.en: After Enlil’s frown 
r.en: had slain Kiš as if it were the Bull of Heaven, 
r.en: had slaughtered the house of the land of Uruk in the dust as if it were a mighty bull, 
r.en: Then, to Sargon, king of Agade, 
r.en: from the south as far as the highlands did Enlil 
r.en: give the rulership and kingship. 
r.en: at that time, holy inanna established the sanctuary of Agade 
r.en: as her celebrated woman’s domain; 
r.en: she set up her throne in Ulmaš. 
.en: Like a young man building a house for the first time, 
.en: like a girl establishing a woman’s domain, 
.en: So that the warehouses would be provisioned; 
.en: that dwellings would be founded in the city; 
.en: that its people would eat splendid food; 
.en: that its people would drink splendid beverages; 
.en: that those bathed for holidays would rejoice in the courtyards; 
.en: that the people would throng the places of celebration; 
.en: that acquaintances would dine together; 
.en: that foreigners would cruise about like unusual birds in the sky; 
.en: that even Marhaši would be re-entered on the tribute rolls; 
.en: that monkeys, mighty elephants, water buffalo, exotic animals 
.en: would jostle each other in the public squares. 
.en: as well as thoroughbred dogs, lions, {mountain ibexes}, and alum sheep with long wool 
.en: holy inanna did not sleep as she ensured all of this. 
.en: She then filled Agade’s stores for emmer wheat with gold, 
.en: she filled its stores for white emmer wheat with silver; 
.en: she delivered copper, tin, and blocks of lapis lazuli to its granaries 
.en: and sealed its silos from outside. 
.en: She endowed its old women with the gift of giving counsel, 
.en: she endowed its old men with the gift of eloquence. 
.en: She endowed its young women with the gift of entertaining, 
.en: she endowed its young men with martial might, 
.en: she endowed its little ones with joy 
.en: The nursemaids who cared for the general’s children 
.en: played the drumsticks. 
.en: Inside the city tigi drums sounded; outside it, flutes and zamzam instruments. 
.en: Its harbour where ships moored was full of joy. 
.en: All foreign lands rested contentedly, 
.en: and their people experienced happiness. 
.en: Its king, the shepherd Naram-Suen, 
.en: rose as the daylight on the holy throne of Agade. 
.en: Its city wall, like a mountain, reached the heavens. 
.en: Its city-gates were like the Tigris {going to} the sea 
.en: when Inanna opened its portals 
.en: and made Sumer bring its own possessions upstream by boats. 
.en: The highland Martu, people ignorant of agriculture, 
.en: brought spirited cattle and kids for her. 
.en: The Meluḫans, the people of the black land, 
.en: brought exotic wares up to her. 
.en: Elam and Subir loaded themselves with goods for her as if they were packasses. 
.en: All the governors, the temple administrators, 
.en: and the accountants of the Gu-edina 
.en: regularly supplied the monthly and New Year offerings. 
.en: What a weariness all these caused at Agade’s city gates! 
.en: Holy inanna could hardly receive all these offerings. 
.en: As if she were a citizen there, she could not restrain (?) the desire (?) to prepare the ground for a temple. 
.en: But the statement coming from the E-kur was disquieting. 
.en: Because of Enlil (?) all Agade was reduced (?) to trembling, 
.en: and terror befell inanna in Ulmaš. 
.en: She left the city, returning to her home. 
.en: Like someone abandoning the young women of her woman’s domain, 
.en: Holy inanna abandoned the sanctuary of Agade 
.en: Like a warrior hurrying to arms, 
.en: she removed the gift of battle and fight from the city 
.en: and handed them over to the enemy. 
.en: Not even five or 10 days had passed 
.en: and the jewels of rulership, the royal crown, 
.en: the emblem and the royal throne bestowed on Agade, 
.en: did Ninurta bring back into his E-šu-me-ša. 
.en: Utu took away the eloquence of the city. 
.en: Enki took away its wisdom. 
.en: Its fearsomeness that reaches heaven, 
.en: An took up into the midst of heaven. 
.en: Its well-anchored holy mooring pole 
.en: Enki tore out from the abzu. 
.en: inanna took away its weapons. 
.en: The life of Agade’s sanctuary was brought to an end as if it had been only the life of a tiny carp in the deep waters, 
.en: and all the cities were watching it. 
.en: Like a mighty elephant, it bent its neck to the ground 
.en: while they all raised their horns like mighty bulls. 
.en: Like a dying dragon, it dragged its head on the earth 
.en: and they jointly deprived it of honour as in a battle. 
.en: Enlil would not let the kingdom of Agade occupy a pleasant, lasting residence, 
.en: that he would make its future altogether unfavourable, 
.en: that he would make its temples shake and would scatter its treasures - 
.en: - Naram-Suen saw that in a nocturnal vision. 
.en: He realised what the dream was about, but did not put into words, and did not discuss it with anyone. 
.en: ... temples shake ... 
.en: ... perform (?) extispicy regarding (?) his temple ... 
.en: Because of the E-kur, he put on mourning clothes, 
.en: covered his chariot with a reed mat, 
.en: tore the reed canopy off his ceremonial barge, 
.en: and gave away his royal paraphernalia. 
.en: Naram-Suen persisted for seven years! 
.en: Who has ever seen a king burying his head in his hands for seven years? 
en: He realised what the dream was about, but did not put into words, and did not discuss it with anyone. 
.en: Then he went to perform extispicy on a kid regarding the temple, 
.en: but the omen had nothing to say about the building of the temple. 
.en: For a second time he went to perform extispicy on a kid regarding the temple, 
.en: but the omen again had nothing to say about the building of the temple. 
.en: In order to change what had been inflicted (?) upon him, 
.en: he tried to to alter Enlil’s pronouncement. 
en: Because his subjects were dispersed, 
en: he now began a mobilization of his troops. 
en: Like a wrestler who is about to enter the great courtyard, 
en: he ...... his hands towards (?) the E-kur. 
en: Like an athlete bent to start a contest, 
en: he treated the giguna as if it were worth only thirty shekels. 
en: Like a robber plundering the city, 
en: he set tall ladders against the temple. 
en: To demolish E-kur as if it were a huge ship, 
en: to break up its soil like the soil of mountains where precious metals are mined, 
en: to splinter it like the lapis lazuli mountain, 
en: to prostrate it like a city inundated by Iškur; 
en: alhough the temple was not the Mountains of Cedar-felling, 
en: he had large axes cast, 
en: he had double-edged agasilig axes sharpened to be used against it. 
en: He set spades against its roots 
en: and it sank as low as the foundation of the Land. 
en: He put axes against its top, 
en: and the temple, like a dead soldier, bowed its neck before him, 
en: and all the foreign lands bowed their necks before him. 
en: He ripped out its drain pipes, 
en: and all the rain went back to the heavens. 
en: He tore off its upper lintel and the Land was deprived of its ornament. 
en: From its Gate from which Grain is never Diverted, he diverted grain, 
en: and the Land was deprived of grain. 
en: He struck the Gate of Well-Being with the pickaxe, 
en: and well-being was subverted in all the foreign lands. 
en: As if they were for great tracts of land with wide carp-filled waters, 
en: he cast large spades to be used against the E-kur. 
en: The people could see the bedchamber, its room which knows no daylight. 
en: They could look into the holy treasure chest of the gods. 
en: its laḫama deities of the great pilasters standing at the temple, 
en: though they had committed no sacrilege, 
en: were thrown into the fire by Naram-Suen. 
en: The cedar, cypress, juniper and boxwood, 
en: the woods of its giguna, were ... by him. 
en: He put its gold in containers 
en: and put its silver in leather bags. 
en: He filled the docks with its copper, as if it were a huge transport of grain. 
en: The silversmiths were re-shaping its silver, 
en: jewellers were re-shaping its precious stones, 
en: smiths were beating its copper. 
en: Though they were not the goods of a plundered city, 
en: large ships were moored at the temple, 
en: large ships were moored at Enlil’s temple 
en: and its possessions were taken away from the city. 
en: With the possessions being taken away from the city, 
en: good sense left Agade. 
en: As the ships moved away from the docks, Agade’s intelligence was removed. 
en: The roaring storm that subjugates the entire land, 
en: the rising deluge that cannot be confronted, 
en: Enlil was considering what should be destroyed in return for the wrecking of his beloved E-kur. 
en: He lifted his gaze towards the Gubin mountains, 
en: and made all the inhabitants of the broad mountain ranges descend (?). 
en: Those who do not resemble other people, who are not reckoned as part of the Land, 
en: the Gutians, an unbridled people, 
en: with human intelligence but canine instincts and monkeys’ features - 
en: Enlil brought them out of the mountains. 
en: Like small birds they swooped on the ground in great flocks. 
en: Because of Enlil, they stretched their arms out across the plain like a net for animals. 
en: Nothing escaped their clutches, 
en: no one left their grasp. 
en: Messengers no longer travelled the highways, 
en: the courier’s boat no longer passed along the rivers. 
en: The Gutians drove the trusty (?) goats of Enlil out of their folds and compelled their herdsmen to follow them, they drove the cows out of their pens and compelled their cowherds to follow them. 
en: they drove the cows out of their pens and compelled their cowherds to follow them. 
en: Prisoners manned the watch. 
en: Brigands occupied the highways. 
en: The doors of the city gates of the Land lay dislodged in mud, 
en: and all the foreign lands uttered bitter cries from the walls of their cities. 
en: They established gardens for themselves within the cities, and not as usual on the wide plain outside. 
en: As if it had been before the time when cities were built and founded, 
en: the large arable tracts yielded no grain, 
en: the inundated tracts yielded no fish, 
en: the irrigated orchards yielded no syrup or wine, 
en: the thick clouds (?) did not rain, the mašgurum plant did not grow. 
en: In those days, oil for one shekel was only half a litre, 
en: grain for one shekel was only half a litre, 
en: wool for one shekel was only one mina, 
en: fish for one shekel filled only one ban measure 
en: these sold at such prices in the markets of the cities! 
en: Those who lay down on the roof, died on the roof; 
en: those who lay down in the house were not buried. 
en: People were flailing at themselves from hunger. 
en: By the Ki-ur, Enlil’s great place, 
en: dogs were packed together in the silent streets; 
en: if two men walked there they would be devoured by them, 
en: and if three men walked there they would be devoured by them. 
en: Noses were punched (?), heads were smashed (?), 
en: noses (?) were piled up, heads were sown like seeds. 
en: Honest people were confounded with traitors, 
en: heroes lay dead on top of heroes, 
en: the blood of traitors ran upon the blood of honest men. 
en: At that time, Enlil rebuilt his great sanctuaries 
en: into small reed (?) sanctuaries 
en: and from east to west he reduced their storehouses. 
en: The old women who survived those days, 
en: the old men who survived those days, 
en: and the chief lamentation singer who survived those years 
en: for seven days and seven nights 
en: set up seven balaĝ drums, 
en: ub, meze, and lilis drums made them resound to Enlil like Iškur. 
en: The old women did not restrain the cry “Alas for my city!” 
en: The old men did not restrain the cry “Alas for its people!” 
en: The lamentation singer did not restrain the cry “Alas for the E-kur!” 
en: Its young women did not restrain from tearing their hair. 
en: Its young men did not restrain from sharpening their knives. 
en: Their laments were as if Enlil’s ancestors 
en: were performing a lament in the awe-inspiring Holy Mound by the holy knees of Enlil. 
en: Because of this, Enlil entered his holy bedchamber and lay down fasting. 
en: At that time, Suen, Enki, inanna, Ninurta, Iškur, Utu, Nuska, and Nisaba, the great gods 
en: cooled Enlil’s heart with cool water and prayed to him: 
en: “Enlil, may the city that destroyed your city be treated as your city has been treated! 
en: May the one that defiled your giguna be treated as Nibru! 
en: In this city, may heads fill the wells! 
en: May no one find his acquaintances there, 
en: may brother not recognise brother! 
en: May its young woman be cruelly killed in her woman’s domain, 
en: may its old man cry in distress for his slain wife! 
en: May its pigeons moan on their window ledges, 
en: may its small birds be smitten in their nooks, 
en: may it live in constant anxiety like a timid pigeon!” 
en: Again, Suen, Enki, inanna, Ninurta, Iškur, Utu, Nuska and Nisaba, all the gods whosoever, 
en: turned their attention to the city, 
en: and cursed Agade severely: 
en: “City, you pounced on E-kur: it is as if you had pounced on Enlil! 
en: Agade, you pounced on E-kur: it is as if you had pounced on Enlil! 
en: May your holy walls, to their highest point, resound with mourning! 
en: May your giguna be reduced to a pile of dust! 
en: May your pilasters with the standing lahama deities 
en: fall to the ground like tall young men drunk on wine! 
en: May your clay be returned to its abzu, 
en: may it be clay cursed by Enki! 
en: May your grain be returned to its furrow, 
en: may it be grain cursed by Ezina! 
en: May your timber be returned to its forest, 
en: may it be timber cursed by Ninilduma! 
en: May the cattle slaughterer slaughter his wife, 
en: may your sheep butcher butcher his child! 
en: May water wash away your pauper as he is looking for ...! 
en: May your prostitute hang herself at the entrance to her brothel! 
en: May your pregnant (?) priestesses and cult prostitutes abort (?) their children! 
en: May your gold be bought for the price of silver, 
en: may your silver be bought for the price of pyrite (?), 
en: and may your copper be bought for the price of lead!” 
en: “Agade, may your strong man be deprived of his strength, 
en: so that he will be unable to lift his sack of provisions and ..., 
en: and will not have the joy of controlling your superior asses; may he lie idle all day! 
en: May this make the city die of hunger! 
en: May your citizens, who used to eat fine food, lie hungry, 
en: may your ... man 
en: eat the coating on his roof, 
en: The leather hinges on the main door of his father’s house, 
en: may he chew their leather hinges! 
en: May depression descend upon your palace, built for joy! 
en: May the evils of the desert, the silent place, howl continuously!” 
en: “Your uzga precinct, established for purification ceremonies, 
en: may foxes that frequent its ruin mounds and brush it with their tails 
en: Your gateways, established for the Land, 
en: May the ukuku, the bird of depression, make its nest in them! 
en: In your city that could not sleep because of the tigi drums, 
en: that could not rest from its joy, 
en: may the bulls of Nanna that fill the pens 
en: bellow like those who wander in the desert, the silent place! 
en: May the grass grow long on your canal-bank tow-paths, 
en: may the grass of mourning grow on your highways laid for waggons! 
en: Moreover, on your tow-paths built up with canal sediment, 
en: may ... wild rams (?) and alert snakes of the mountains allow no one to pass! 
en: In your plains where fine grass grows, may the reed of lamentation grow! 
en: Agade, may brackish water flow, where fresh water flowed for you! 
en: If someone decides, “I will dwell in this city!,” may he not enjoy the pleasures of a dwelling place! 
en: If someone decides, “I will rest in Agade!,” may he not enjoy the pleasures of a resting place!” 
en: And before Utu on that very day, so it was! 
en: On its canal bank tow-paths, the grass grew long. 
en: On its highways laid for waggons, the grass of mourning grew. 
en: Moreover, on its tow-paths built up with canal sediment, 
en: wild rams (?) and alert snakes of the mountains allowed no one to pass. 
en: On its plains, where fine grass grew, now the reeds of lamentation grew. 
en: Agade’s flowing fresh water flowed as brackish water. 
en: When someone decided, “I will dwell in that city!,” he could not enjoy the pleasures of a dwelling place. 
en: When someone decided, “I will rest in Agade!,” 
en: For the destruction of Agade, Inanna be praised! 
.en: Enki took away its wisdom. 
.en: Its fearsomeness that reaches heaven, 
.en: An took it up into the midst of heaven. 
.en: Its well-anchored holy mooring pole, 
.en: Enki tore it out from the abzu 
r.en: That he would make its future altogether unfavourable; 
r.en: that he would make its temples shake and would scatter its treasures - 
r.en: - Naram-Suen saw that in a nocturnal vision.

r.en: Like a robber plundering the city,

r.en: and the Land was deprived of grain.

en: The lamenters who perform the dirges 
en: respond to it sorrowfully.

en: As the evening came,

en: At the gate of Ganzer, in front of the nether world, he sat down. 
en: Gilgamesh wept, crying bitterly: 
en: “O my ball (?)! O my mallet (?)! 
en: My ball (?), I am still not satiated with its charms,

en: If only my ball (?) waited still in the carpenter’s house for me!

en: My ball (?) has fallen down to the nether world—who will retrieve it for me? 
en: My mallet (?) has fallen down to Ganzer—who will retrieve it for me? 
en: His servant Enkidu answered: 
en: “My king, you weep; why does your heart worry? 
en: Today I shall retrieve your ball (?) from the nether world,

en: Gilgamesh answered Enkidu: 
en: “If today you are going to go down to the nether world, 
en: let me advise you! My instructions should be followed. 
en: Let me talk to you! Pay attention to my words!" 
en: “You should not put on your clean garments: 
en: they would recognise immediately that you are alien. 
en: You should not anoint yourself with fine oil from a bowl: 
en: they would surround you at its scent. 
en: You should not hurl throw-sticks in the nether world: 
en: those struck down by the throw-sticks would surround you. 
en: You should not not hold a cornel-wood stick in your hand: 
en: the spirits would feel insulted by you. 
en: You should not put sandals on your feet. 
en: You should not shout in the nether world.

en: You should not hit your wife even if you are annoyed with her. 
en: You should not kiss your beloved child. 
en: You should not hit your son even if you are annoyed with him. 
en: The outcry aroused would detain you in the nether world.” 
en: “She who lies there, she who lies there, 
en: Ninazu’s mother who lies there— 
en: her pure shoulders are not covered with a garment, 
en: and no linen is spread over her pure breast. 
en: She has fingers like a pickaxe, 
en: she plucks her hair out like leeks.” 
en: Enkidu, however, did not heed not his master’s words. 
en: He put on his clean garments 
en: and they recognised that he was alien. 
en: He anointed himself with fine oil from a bowl 
en: and they surrounded him at its scent. 
en: He hurled throw-sticks in the nether world 
en: and those struck down by the throw-sticks surrounded him. 
en: He held a cornel-wood stick in his hand 
en: and the spirits felt insulted by him. 
en: He put sandals on his feet. 
en: He caused irritation in the nether world. 
en: He kissed his beloved wife 
en: and hit his wife when he was annoyed with her. 
en: He kissed his beloved child 
en: and hit his son when he was annoyed with him. 
en: He aroused an outcry and was detained in the nether world. 
en: The warrior Gilgamesh, son of Ninsumun, 
en: directed his steps on his own to E-kur, the temple of Enlil. 
en: He cried before Enlil: 
en: “Father Enlil, my ball (?) fell down into the nether world, my mallet (?) fell down into Ganzer. 
en: Enkidu went down to retrieve them but the nether world has seized him. 
en: Namtar did not seize him, the Asag did not seize him; but the nether world has seized him. 
en: The udug demon of Nergal, who spares nobody, did not seize him, but the nether world has seized him. 
en: He did not fall in battle on the field of manhood, but the nether world has seized him.” 
en: Father Enlil did not stand by him in the matter, so he went to Eridu. 
en: In Eridu he directed his steps on his own to the temple of Enki. 
en: He cried before Enki: 
en: “Father Enki, my ball (?) fell down into the nether world, my mallet (?) fell down into Ganzer. 
en: Enkidu went down to retrieve them but the nether world has seized him. 
en: Namtar did not seize him, the Asag did not seize him; but the nether world has seized him. 
en: The udug demon of Nergal, who spares nobody, did not seize him, but the nether world has seized him. 
en: He did not fall in battle on the field of manhood, but the nether world has seized him.” 
en: Father Enki stood by him in this matter. 
en: He said to the young warrior Utu, the son born by Ningal: 
en: “Open a window in the nether world immediately, 
en: and then bring up his servant from the nether world!” 
en: He opened a window in the nether world 
en: and brought up his servant with his breeze (?) from the nether world. 
en: They hugged and kissed. 
en: They wearied each other with questions: 
en: “Did you see the order of the nether world? 
en: If only you would tell me, my friend, if only you would tell me!” 
en: “If I tell you the order of the nether world, 
en: si yourself down and weep! I shall sit down and weep! 
en: ..., which your heart rejoiced to touch, 
en: is ..., 
en: worms infest it like an old garment (?); 
en: like ... of (?) a crevice, it is full of dust.” 
en: “Alas!” he said and sat down in the dust. 
en: “Did you see him who had 1 son?” “I saw him.” “How does he fare?” 
en: “He weeps bitterly at the wooden peg which was driven into his wall.” 
en: “Did you see him who had 2 sons?” “I saw him.” “How does he fare?”

en: “As a companion of the gods, he sits on a throne and listens to judgments.” 
en: “Did you see the palace eunuch?” “I saw him.” “How does he fare?” 
en: “Like a useless alala stick he is propped in a corner.” 
en: “Did you see the woman who never gave birth?” “I saw her.” “How does she fare?” 
en: “Like a ... pot, she is thrown away violently, she gives no man joy.”

en: “Did you see the young woman who never undressed her husband?” “I saw her.” “How does she fare?” 
en: “You finish a reed mat, and she weeps over the reed mat.”
